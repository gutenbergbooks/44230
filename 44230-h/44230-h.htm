<p class="chapterintro">"Books were made that man might pass his knowledge
to his fellows; through them he speaks to a vast audience,
and his power to enlighten is only circumscribed
by the ability to impart this knowledge in lucid and
interesting language."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p class="subheader">ON THIS BOOK</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">My</span> reason for writing this book is, that it is wanted;
my excuse, thirty years' experience. In those
years I have handled many boats, upon many
waters.</p>

<p>You will find this book very different from other works
on the same subject. In the first place, I believe that all
text-books should be written in a manner to please, as
well as to instruct; that they should be agreeable reading;
and, aside from their teaching value, have a certain excellence
as a writing. Again, there is nothing in literature
so interesting as the autobiography, real or fictional.
Nearly all our great works of fiction are of this class.
Robinson Crusoe's history from any other lips than those
of the castaway would lose half its interest; Gil Blas in
the third person would lack warmth and be wholly devoid
of its peculiar zest. The flavor of the individual is
lost when you speak for, and not as him. The puppet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
talks like a puppet. It is the difference between John
Alden pleading the cause of Captain Standish and John
Alden pleading the cause of Master John. Let a man
talk to you and he will interest and amuse; let him write
for you and he will prove trite and dull. Therefore, when
imparting information, I like to talk, not write. I want
to infuse into my words my person, to endeavor to give
my ideas an I-am-with-you tone, so that it will be me
and not the book that is present, and with whom you are
in communion.</p>

<p>But this method of handling a subject is apt to breed
dogmatism, especially as the reader is unable to question
or deny the statements made until they have been
chilled into ink. So you will find in many of my chapters
that I am exceedingly dogmatic. It is unintentional, simply
being a manifestation of the spirit peculiar to this style of
addressing an audience&mdash;one that must hear but cannot
answer. Therefore let me warn you to question all my
statements, and to accept only those that harmonize with
your own conclusions, after you have carefully thought
them over. Those that you cannot reconcile to your own
knowledge and experience, lay on one side to be tried out
at a future day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>Never, no matter how high the authority, accept any
man's coin by its minted face. It is as easy to strike a
base as a sterling piece, and the king's head on the reverse
and his arms on the obverse won't make lead silver,
or copper gold. This in regard to statements made by
those who set themselves up as authorities on a subject
is particularly true, when the subject is one like this
under discussion; one in which no fixed rules may be
established, and where so much depends upon the man,
the place and the means. I make a statement of practice;
it was deduced from my personal experience, and in my
case gave a perfect result; you follow it, but owing to
certain complicating circumstances, in your case, it fails.
For instance, I tell you, that when a vessel gets sternway
on in a seaway to keep your helm amidships, and cast
her with the headsails, and not to put your helm hard
over. You accept my method as being the correct one,
try it, and fail to cast your boat so as to fill away. This
does not prove that I am wrong in making such a statement,
but it shows that I am wrong in not having qualified
it. It also shows that you are a lax thinker in not
having questioned my method before putting it in practice.
My error is the too frequent error of men who write on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
vessel handling; yours the too common error of men
who study their books.</p>

<p>The object of this book, of these talks, is not to fill
you, parrot fashion, full of rules of action or methods of
practice, but to furnish you with food for thought; to
lay before you certain statements from which you must,
to a large extent, deduce your own conclusions. Take
what I say, mix it with your own knowledge and experience,
and put into action the result.</p>

<p>These talks are not intended for men who are what we
may call seamen, men who are thoroughly versed in the
art, nor are they intended for those who aspire to boats
larger than forty feet over all. A boat above that size
is too valuable to be trusted in the hands of an inexperienced
or half-trained man. The owner of a large
yacht, if he is not perfectly capable of handling her under
all conditions, should hire some one who is. My sermons
are addressed to the man who is learning to handle a
small vessel, who wants to be a seaman, and who, to be
free of all paid assistance, is willing to study the art
thoroughly and make himself master of all its branches.</p>

<p class="subheader">ON SEAMANSHIP</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">I have</span> been all my life a lover of the sea; an observer
of its natural and social conditions; a student of its
phases and fabrics; but while my mind in its long
and wide search has touched upon almost every subject
connected with ocean life, the one that has constantly interested
and fascinated me is that which relates to the
care and government of sailing vessels. This art, which
is called seamanship, is one of man's oldest and noblest
attainments. What does the world owe to him who
possessed it?</p>

<p>To him the civilization of to-day owes its existence.
Man cramped in the confines of a continent, a prisoner
at low-water mark, a dwarf in a dwarf world, was released,
lifted and enlightened by the Master of the Sail.
It was he who found the universe upon the sea, and
brought it home; a free gift, with the more costly but less
valuable trophies of distant trade. It was he who,
broadening the world's world, broadened the world's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
mind. With the spices and silks of the East, with the
gold and tobaccos of the West, he laded his ships with
the new knowledge, a commodity that paid no revenues
to the crown, that added nothing to the wealth and glory
of princes, but, flowing slowly and steadily into the minds
of men, incited the intelligent few to broader, nobler and
more splendid achievements, and filtering through the
masses, long steeped in inveterate ignorance, uplifted, enriched
and regenerated all.</p>

<p>In the shadow of his sail hamlets became cities; wealth
increased, suffering diminished. In his callous hands,
the helm, that through daylight and darkness guided his
vessel from land to land, was more marvelous in its
powers than the famed ivory wand of the Eastern genii;
and to all who sought to receive, his sail bore more
jewels than ever burdened the magic carpet, or came
into the hands of the daring and fortunate through the
incantations of the Sons of the Hidden Light. While
with one hand he struggled with chaffering Trade for her
sordid coin, with the other he threw into the laps of
Science and Art innumerable treasures. Impartial in his
generosity as in his gifts, he gave to Astronomy new
constellations, to Medicine rare and efficacious herbs, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
Art fresh and invigorating colors, and to Literature a
strange breed of heroes, novel situations and unfamiliar
plots.</p>

<p>The freedom that he found upon the high seas he
brought back to cheer the slaves of the mart. Kings
bargained for his services, nobles and merchants offered
their purses to assist in his ventures. In return for three
paltry vessels he presented Spain with an empire; to
prove a chimera false he perished among the northern
ices. No sea was too broad to daunt him; no land was
too distant to escape his search. The miseries he endured,
the hardships he underwent, were forgotten in the joys
of a new discovery. He opened roads of trade that
brought riches and power to his country, and sprinkled
these pathways with the bones of his companions&mdash;victims
of exposure, famine and disease.</p>

<p>No reef lifts above the water, no shallow spreads its
treacherous sands, but the frames of his vessel have been
broken upon it. The hurricane and calm have taken toll
of him; he has paid the penalty of recklessness and greed.
He has given to the annals of war its most desperate and
bloody conflicts; he has perished that nations might live,
and that a people might be free.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>His life gave him strength and endurance; his art made
him skillful and courageous. He created and used a
language of his own, and his customs were not those of
other men. The inventor of the sail, the user of the
elements, the discoverer, the trader, the protector, the
world's benefactor&mdash;the seaman.</p>

<p>A noble art makes noble men, and there is no nobler art
than seamanship. As free and changeful in its measures
as are the elements it employs and combats, it is prolific
of resource, fertile in expedient, and a prompter of mental
activity. It promotes skill of hand and tenacity of muscle.
Courage is bred in its duties, and the mind broadens
in its services.</p>

<p>It is this that makes the practice of seamanship so valuable
to those who employ it only as a pastime. The
care and handling of the sailing vessel furnishes most
excellent training for the young. Aside from the skill it
imparts, it takes men out into the open air; it offers to
those whom the obligations of life keep at the counter
and desk an opportunity to be free, to get away from and
completely out of the business world. It gives the mart-worn
mind a change and a rest. The sea has no postmen;
no telegraph messengers. It prints no newspa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>pers. The feet of society merely tread its borders. It is
a place where man is really free, and where he can realize
his freedom.</p>

<p>Many have written upon this art. Some of these
works are an addition to literature and of value to the
seaman, but the majority are not. On that branch of seamanship,
which we will call yachtmanship, and which is
principally the art of sparring, rigging, canvasing and
handling fore-and-aft vessels, there has been penned several
large works and many small ones. The standard
books are by Vanderdecken and Kemp, and the majority
of the others, I am sorry to say, are in the most part
copies of these two. In some cases the authors have
lifted their information bodily, and have forgotten to acknowledge
the indebtedness. While standard works of
their time, both Vanderdecken and Kemp are now out
of date, and, moreover, they deal largely with big vessels,
and vessels of a type no longer employed in yachting.</p>

<p>Among the smaller works there are several good ones,
but they lack originality and do not properly cover the
ground, nor do they contain the information which is
most necessary to the beginner. Again, many of them
have been written by men who are enslaved by one type,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
and are therefore considerably biased; others are from
the pen of those who have had a special and not a general
experience.</p>

<p>But the crowning defect of all these books, to my
mind, is that the authors in the portion relating to handling
try to teach a man, instead of prompting him to
learn. You cannot teach a man to sail&mdash;he may learn.
In order to do so he must have the sailor instinct. Unless
he has that he will never become a seaman. That is
why some men can never learn to handle a boat, and why
others will pick up the knowledge in a few months.</p>

<p>Again, there are many men who learn to sail a boat;
that is, become possessed of so much knowledge as will
permit of their working a vessel from place to place, but
yet never succeed in mastering the nicer or more difficult
points of seamanship. These are the parrots of the profession&mdash;men
who simply repeat what they see other men
do. The skillful seaman is the man who thinks, who
studies his profession, and who learns from his own experience
what he cannot from the practice of others.</p>

<p>It is often said that experience is the great teacher.
To be sure it is; but even experience cannot teach one
who will not learn. The most intense and varied expe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>rience is of no use to one who casts it aside without first
fitting it into place in his life's record by turning it over
and over in his mind. Spasmodic storage of experience
is of no use whatever; it must be sorted, checked up,
ticketed and stored away in its proper place in the next
bin to that which it joins in the sequence of events. Unless
this is done it will not be forthcoming when needed.</p>

<p>Properly arranged and stored, experience is the mother
of what is called "presence of mind," the most necessary
mental part for a seaman to possess. Without it he will
be a menace to his own safety and a threat of danger to
others. Presence of mind is simply applied forethought.
You do in an emergency without apparent reflection the
right thing, and save your boat, your life, or somebody
else's life. People who see the act, exclaim, "What wonderful
presence of mind!" but would be more correct, if
they exclaimed, "What perfect presence of plan!" You
have simply executed at a moment's notice a plan of action
that has been stored away in your mind, perhaps for
years.</p>

<p>When a boy, I frequently amused myself when skating
by thinking out what I would do if a person fell through
the ice. I pictured all possible situations and methods of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
rescue. One day the accident happened; a boy in skating
across the head of a pond broke through the thin
ice formed where the river entered the lake. From the
hundred skaters present a yell of terror went up, and, as
was the case when the immortal Mr. Pickwick met with
a similar accident at Dingley Dell, everybody called for
help, and nobody offered it. Though at some distance,
my attention was drawn to the mishap by these cries.
Instantly I responded. There was no mental preparation,
no reflection; the proper plan flashed into my acting
mind. I executed it, and the boy was saved.</p>

<p>Now, if I had not had that plan stored in my mind, I
should have been just as much at sea as the rest were.
I should probably have joined them in shouting for a
plank or rope, or, like Mr. Tupman, have cried fire, or
performed some other senseless act, such as people do
when brought suddenly face to face with a dangerous
emergency.</p>

<p>One day when running down wind I said to the young
fellow at the wheel, who was anxious to learn the seaman's
trade, "What would you do if one of us fell overboard?"
"I don't know," he answered. "Haven't you
ever thought, planned out, what you would do in such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
an emergency?" No, he hadn't. "Well," I said, "you
think it out; put the boat in different positions and under
different sail, and plan out what you would do if such
an accident happened." A day or two after, while the
same lad was at the wheel, we lost the dingey. Without
calling me from below or hesitating, he wore round and
recovered the boat, executing the manoeuvre in so clever
a manner as to call praise from all the old hands. When,
shortly after, I relieved him at the wheel, he said, "I
thought that out the other day after you spoke about
what to do if a man falls overboard."</p>

<p>Again, I was on the bridge of a steamer chatting with
the mate. "What do you do to pass away the long night
watches?" I asked him. "Well," he answered, "I spend
hours thinking and planning out what I would do if certain
things happened. I put the ship into every possible
danger&mdash;fire, collision, shifting cargo, broken shaft, and
unexpected land. I then plan how best to meet the
emergency created. I place other ships in every position&mdash;green
to port, red to starboard, lights dead ahead,
lights on the beam, lights everywhere&mdash;then plan to work
my ship clear of them. I have some run into me, am
sinking, lower boats, save my own crew and rescue oth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>ers. I pick up lame ducks, pass hawsers, make fast and
tow them in. Everything that could possibly happen I
have happen, and plan the ways and means of meeting
them over and over again. That is how I while away my
eight hours in the scuppers."</p>

<p>There was a seaman who had prepared himself for an
emergency; a commander who had ready for instant use
a plan, so, let occasion demand it, he could stand forth
the man of the hour.</p>

<p>Let me advise you who would learn the seaman's art
to copy that mate. Spend your idle hours thinking and
planning. Never go into a difficult channel without first
picturing what dangers may confront you, and how you
can overcome them. Never pass through a fleet or come
to anchor among vessels without planning beforehand
your mode of action. Never turn in at night without first
looking about you and outlining in your mind your position
in regard to shore and craft, and forming a plan
for getting away if anything should happen to oblige you
to make sail. After a little practice this thinking ahead
will become second nature, and your brain will plan and
act with the regularity and cheerfulness of a good clock.</p>

<p>The backbone of active seamanship is confidence&mdash;con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>fidence in yourself, confidence in your craft, confidence
in your crew. The first and most necessary of these is
confidence in yourself. Without it the place for you is
on shore, or in a subordinate position. No man should
attempt to command who has shaken confidence in his
own skill and judgment. I mean by confidence the true
article, not the false, which is more commonly called conceit.</p>

<p>Confidence is inspired by action and confirmed by success.
You attempt a feat such as you have never attempted
before and are successful, therefore you are sure
that the skill or knowledge you used in performing it is
reliable, and that you are possessed of a mastery over it
sufficient to enable you to repeat the act. In plain English,
you are sure you can do it again.</p>

<p>Let us suppose it is a feat of navigation. By yourself
you have never taken a yacht out of sight of land, but,
having the opportunity, decide to attempt to run from
one point to another across an open stretch of sea. You
take the chart, find the magnetic course and distance,
allow for leeway and current, and having thus found
your compass course put the ship on it, and away you go.
Land soon drops down astern, and you begin to feel a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
bit shaky. Suppose you have made a mistake in laying
off the course; not allowed enough for leeway, too much
for current. Suppose you should miss the distant cape.
This and a dozen other things begin to haunt your mind.
You go below, out with the chart, pass over your figures,
remeasure the distance, get the same result for compass
course&mdash;we will say N. E. by E.½E. You go back on
deck confident that your course and distance are correct,
and then begin to worry about the compass. You are
sure it was correct yesterday, because you took several
bearings and found it so, and it was also correct two
weeks before, on your last cruise. Then you reason that
it is very unlikely that it would go waltzing off into an
excessive error just because it happened to have been
taken out of sight of land for the first time, and so give it
back your confidence and steer away N. E. by E.½E.</p>

<p>Your crew now begin to worry, never having been out
of sight of land before. They look at you as though
they suspected you of contemplating their murder. They
walk around uneasily, search the horizon ahead, and cast
regretful glances at the one astern, pay repeated visits to
the log and act generally like a set of condemned victims.
Your confidence under this condition begins to wilt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
again. You take the log index, go below, and find that
your passage is half made. You show this to the crew,
and they appear half satisfied and half doubtful, despite
your assumed air of implicit faith. They seem to know
that your face is acting, and that your stomach is not
backing up the play. Just then the helmsman calls out
that a steamship is in sight ahead. The smoke-boat approaches
rapidly, running almost on the back-bearing
to the one your craft is on&mdash;S. W. by W., as near as you
can make it. As she draws near you recognize her as a
coaster running between the place you are bound to and
the place you have left. Here is positive evidence that
you are on the right track. You strut round the cockpit
with the airs of an admiral, and the timid members of
your crew shrink into their lower garments.</p>

<p>But a few hours after passing the steamer, night
comes on, and it begins to blow and get nasty. You call
all hands, reef down, and thus check your speed, so that
instead of making six knots you are only doing four.
Then the wind hauls a bit more forward, and you have
to flatten-in your sheets. This increases your leeway,
and you decide to allow another point for it&mdash;making
your course N. E., ½ E. Then you wonder if that is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
enough, and again begin to worry. By this time your
crew have accepted their fate, and are in a profound state
of despair, beyond even a murmur of insubordination, doing
their work slowly and sullenly, as though every act
was a part of a preparation to commit suicide.</p>

<p>Down to the chart you go again; pass over the course,
and pricking off the distance, find that you are by your
reckoning still twenty miles from the landfall you expect
to make. The light on it is visible fifteen miles. Laying
out this on the chart, you see that you can hardly miss
hitting that big circle, and are somewhat assured. Now
the wind falls light, and instead of being within the range
of visibility of the light in an hour or so, it is three before
the log says you have run far enough. You carefully
search the horizon for it. No light is visible. A cold
sweat begins to break out. You are lost&mdash;lost at sea.
You must have allowed too little for leeway and have
passed far outside of the light. What had you better do,
keep your course, or haul up? After thinking it over,
and again consulting the chart, you decide to hold the
course for an hour longer. How slowly that hour drags
away! At its expiration the log shows three and one-half
miles more. You are now by your reckoning eleven and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
one-half miles from the light. Certainly you must see it.
A long search with the glass; no light. You decide to
haul up and try for it to the north'rd and west'rd, but
before doing so have one more look. Hello! there it is,
a point on the starboard bow. That's the light, sure
enough. It flashes; you count ten seconds, fifteen seconds,
darkness; again it flashes ten seconds. "Light ho!"
you shout.</p>

<p>Has your log overrun that amount? You decide it
has; but a few minutes later the light is lost again. That
settles it&mdash;fog or mist inshore; the log is all right. So
you stand boldly on, your whole mind aglow with the
triumph you have just achieved&mdash;that of making a good
landfall. The drama of Columbus at San Salvador is replayed,
you taking the part of the great admiral, and
your crew that of the conscience-stricken mutineers. You
wonder why they ever doubted your skill and knowledge,
forgetting that you doubted yourself.</p>

<p>The next day your crew strut proudly about the port
like a lot of mariners just returned from circumnavigating
the globe. They are proud of you, proud of their vessel,
and very proud of themselves. But what a change it has
worked in you! You are a very different man to-day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
from what you were the hour you took your departure
to make that passage. To-day you have confidence in
your skill and knowledge, and in yourself as a user of
those powers.</p>

<p>I have written that little sketch to show you that knowing
how to hand, reef and steer is not all that is needed
to make a seaman. The knowledge of the methods of
working sails and ship are only a part of the seaman's
craft. His head as well as his hand must be trained.
He must not only know his vessel thoroughly, but he
must as thoroughly know himself.</p>

<p class="subheader">ON BOATS IN GENERAL</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Men</span> frequently come to me, and ask, "What sort of a
boat would you recommend me to have?" My
reply always is, "What for?" In that small phrase
is contained the kernel of selection&mdash;what for? Do you
want to cruise, go day-sailing, or race? Do you want it
to go alone, or with a crew? Do you want to sail in
rough or smooth water?</p>

<p>A boat that is suitable for cruising is not the thing for
racing or day-sailing; a boat that would fill the bill if
used on land-locked waters would make a poor showing
on an open sea or in rough stretches of tide-swept channel.</p>

<p>Let us first consider the racing craft. Racing, as I
have often told you, is a business, not a pastime. If you
want to win, and those who race usually do, you must
subordinate everything to that want. If you don't, you
will never be a successful mug hunter. A racing boat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a><br /><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
must be built as lightly as the law allows. This not only
means that her frame and planking must be kept down
to eights, but she must be looted of everything that the
rules will permit you to remove. She must have large,
well-made and consequently expensive sails. Her gear
must be of the finest and strongest make, and it must be
kept up to the top notch of perfection by constant supervision
and repair.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p>Then you must give up all below comforts and consent
to live on bare necessities. You must forego all other
pleasures and concentrate all your faculties on one thing&mdash;your
boat. If you are willing to do this, and have the
racing skipper eye and hand, you may pull out all right
on top.</p>

<p>If, instead of racing, you just want a boat to knock
round in during the day, your craft is far more easily
chosen and secured. You won't have to read up several
volumes of restrictions and rules, you won't have to nose
through half a dozen classes to find the one in which the
easiest-to-beat crowd harbor, before making up your
mind and giving out your order. You can just suit yourself
as to how long, how wide and how deep your craft
is to be.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>A boat for day-sailing wants to be of strong and reasonable
light construction. She needs much more cockpit
than cabin, and if the latter is of the summer variety
it will be far more comfortable and convenient. All boats
should have some sort of a cuddy or cabin, especially if
they are to be used to take out women and children.</p>

<p>A day-sailing boat, if to be used for taking out shore
people, should be absolutely uncapsizable and, if possible,
fitted with tanks of sufficient power to float the ballast.
Her rig should be simple, and her canvas of moderate
expanse. The less gear and gewgaws she has about
her the better, as it means a saving of work at all times,
and especially in getting underway and coming to anchor.</p>

<p>The two best rigs for this class of boat are the cat and
knockabout. Both these rigs are quick and easy to
handle, and having no bowsprit, they can be brought up
to a landing anywhere where there is water enough to
float them.</p>

<p>There is no better day-sailing boat in the world than
the cat that is used along our Eastern seaboard to take
out fishing and sailing parties. I don't mean the over-canvased
brute that is frequently met&mdash;a vessel that takes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a><br /><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
all hands to steer, and a double watch to shorten down,
but the properly sparred and balanced boat. I have
handled many of these boats, and under our ordinary
summer conditions have found them to do what was expected
of them in a boatly manner. In skillful hands they
are as near being absolutely safe as it is possible for any
water-borne fabric to be. One of their chief advantages
is that they can be got under sail or be relieved of it
quicker than any other type. They have but one sheet
and two halliards to look after, and all these can be
tended by one hand without leaving the cockpit.</p>

  <div class="figcaption">
    <p>Racing Pole-Mast Sloop</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The knockabout has many of the cat's good qualities,
and is in some respects a better rig, but the jib is apt to
be a nuisance at times. The disadvantage of the knockabout
is that, being a narrower model than the cat, you
are cramped for room where it is most needed&mdash;aft. Owing
to this latter rig being in fashion, the cat has fallen out
of favor, but there is no better boat for the young sailor
to begin his studies in. An open cat&mdash;that is, one half-decked,
say of sixteen feet length&mdash;is just the thing for a
boy to learn the sailor's trade in.</p>

<p>Now for the cruiser, and its name is legion. But out
of the lot there are more bad than good ones to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
picked. A cruiser, in the first place, is a house&mdash;a home
for days, and perhaps weeks and months. Therefore, she
must furnish sleeping and eating accommodations. This
means room to stretch and stand, or at least sit upright.
A cruiser in which a man cannot live in comfort is no
cruiser.</p>

<p>Then first, in selecting a cruiser, the accommodation
must be looked to; that is why when a man who knows
anything starts to buy one he invariably puts the question,
"What is her head room?" The answer generally tells
the whole story. The next important query is, "What is
her draught?" the third, "What is her rig?"</p>

<p>Unless you can sit up and lie down comfortably the
boat is no cruiser; you can at once make up your
mind to that. While no man expects to spend the greater
part of his time below, the time he does spend below is
that in which he seeks rest, and must get it; this is impossible
in cramped quarters.</p>

<p>The importance of the draught depends largely upon
where you want to sail and harbor. Your draft should
never exceed the low-water depth of the channel you
have to pass through in order to reach your anchorage.
In our northern waters three feet is the minimum draught<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
required; in southern waters less is almost necessary.
In some localities three feet is the maximum draught.
Short draught has the disadvantage of forcing the bulk of
the boat above the water line, and the making of high
houses, in order to get head room. This produces a
boat that offers considerable resistance to the wind, and
consequently makes excessive leeway. They are also
unsteady at anchor, and hard on the ground tackle.</p>

<p>Deep draught cuts you out from many harbors and
sheltering places, and in getting from port to port along
shore frequently obliges you to take the longest way
round, but it has the advantage of giving a firm hold on
the water and of keeping the weights and windages down
low. But, as in everything, there is a happy medium&mdash;a
betwixt and between.</p>

<p>It may be stated that for all reasonable purposes on a
cruising boat of 40 feet and under to be used on our
coast, a draught of five feet is sufficient. All over that will
prove a cause of worry and a hindrance to pleasant voyaging.
With this draught you can pass into nearly all our
bar harbors and navigate with safety among the shoals
in our sounds and channels. I prefer to limit my draught<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a><br /><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
to three feet, but then it is my peculiar pleasure to sail
where other men seldom venture.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <a name="Cutter_Rig" id="Cutter_Rig"><img src="images/illus-043.jpg" width="600" height="477" alt="Cutter Rig" /></a>
  <div class="figcaption">
    <p>Cutter Rig</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>It is difficult to get a weatherly keel boat on four or
even five feet draught. A boat to be good to windward
must have a deep plane of resistance. This makes it
almost impossible to dispense with the centerboard in
small boats. But as soon as you admit this contrivance
into your plans you partly spoil your accommodations.
Many designers have tried to get round this by combining
the two forms. Putting in a half board that
houses in the keel and does not come above the floor.
Such of these as I have seen have proved to be poor
makeshifts, and the result is the spoiling of what would
have been a good keel boat.</p>

<p>While fully aware of its disadvantages, I am a firm believer
in the centerboard for small cruising boats. That
it weakens a vessel there is no doubt, but with the modern
method of building the trunk the injury to the fabric is
very slight. The saying that "A centerboard boat always
leaks" is more fact than fiction, but in several
modern yachts that I have cruised in this is not so, the
trunk having been constructed in such a way as to resist
the strains which are the cause of leakage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>Now to return to the subject of accommodations. A
cruising boat should be of such shape as will give the
largest interior possible in a given length. In this the
older type of yacht was far superior to the modern. In
the boats of to-day a man pays for a great deal of hull that
is of no use to him, except for looks and speed. The long
overhangs provide plenty of deck room, but they add
nothing to the cabin and but little to the storage space.
In an up-to-date boat all that is habitable is the middle
third. In such a craft, 30 feet over all, you can get but 10
feet for cabin. I have seen a 40-foot boat, which was advertised
as a good cruiser, in which there was sleeping
room for two. Compare this with the accommodations
furnished by an old-fashioned plumb-ender, or with a
Cape cat. One of these latter of 20 feet has more room
than a modern 30-footer of the up-to-date model.</p>

<p>The extreme overhangs are all right in racing craft,
but they are a detriment and a danger in cruising craft.
The same may be said of the extreme full bow. There
never was, and probably never will be, a set of ends
better adapted for all-around work than those carried by
the boats of twenty years ago, as shown in Minerva and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
yachts of her day. This is what is known as the half-clipper
or schooner bow.</p>

<p>In boats of this type there is sufficient overhang to
prevent their diving and to give them sufficient buoyancy
to lift easily over a sea, at the same time the ends are not
long enough to trip the vessel if running in large water.
Again, the entrance and run are sharp enough to fall without
pounding&mdash;a disagreeable habit that full modern
boats are possessed of. The most serious objection to
the modern boat with full and long overhangs is that it
will not lay-to in heavy water bow-on. Just as soon as
you put it to the wind and check its headway it will fall
off in a trough and work around stern to the sea, a
very dangerous proceeding. It is a splendid runner, and
remarkably dry when so engaged; in fact, it seldom ships
solid water when going either on or off the wind, and is
less liable to pooping than the older types, but when
brought to face a sea it pounds and sags and is exceedingly
uncomfortable. To one who has never experienced
the sensation it is impossible to picture the punishment
these full-bowed vessels receive when driven against a
head sea. This pounding brings a terrible strain on the
spars and rigging and is very wearying to the crew. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a><br /><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
have known a sea striking under the stern of one of these
boats to throw the crew off their feet, badly injuring one
man. The mate of a large English yacht who had crossed
the Bay of Biscay in her on the way to Gibraltar told me
that he had never in all his sea experience had such a terrible
knocking about. Every man on board was a mass
of bruises when the vessel made port, and the copper
was torn off her bows back for eight or ten feet. Yet
this boat's bow was nothing like so full as that of many
of our yachts of to-day.</p>

  <div class="figcaption">
    <p>Jib and Mainsail Cruising Boat</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>If you go to the other extreme, and cut all end off a
boat, giving her a straight up and down stem, she is a bad
runner and very, very wet. The cutters of this type
were most uncomfortable sea boats, being constantly
deluged, but they would eat out to windward in heavy
weather and lie-to a sea like birds. Between these two
there is the end which is the one for the cruiser to use.</p>

<p>The ideal end is one that will lift and lower slowly,
allowing the vessel to fall and rise without jarring or jerking.
This sort of end will, when falling, bring a vessel
slowly to when the extreme point of the fall is reached.
With the plumb stem a vessel is apt to go too far, deluging
the decks, and in one with the full long bow, not far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
enough, jarring the whole fabric by suddenly checking
the motion. It is of course impossible to have absolutely
perfect ends on a vessel, as concessions have to be made
to other purposes, but the ends of the majority of our
modern yachts are decidedly bad for rough-water work.</p>

<p>Another serious defect in many cruising boats is want
of freeboard. There is no excuse for this. A low-sided
boat is wet and uncomfortable, both inside and out. You
see many boats of this description with scant freeboard
and excessively high houses. The only object to be
gained by keeping the freeboard down is to reduce the
windage and weight, important items in racing craft, but
of little matter in a cruiser. Farther on, in speaking of
handling in rough water, I shall explain the advantages
of freeboard.</p>

<p class="subheader">ON ONE-MAN BOATS</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">This</span> is a subject upon which volumes of rot have
been written by men who ought to have known
better. We can forgive a man of no experience for
writing absurdly upon a subject, but when those who have
had experience in handling craft alone come out in print
in advocacy of an utterly unsuitable type of vessel it is
about time for somebody to call them down. It is the
books of such men that have made common the idea
that the single-hander's vessel must be a sort of enlarged
toy boat; in consequence, whenever a single-hander
is pictured, it is of that type.</p>

<p>The principal cause of this error is that the men who
have taken charge of the task of disseminating information
regarding the single-hander are of a class that, as
a class, look upon small things as making big things and
not as big things being made of small things. Consequently
they give more importance to any part than they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a><br /><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
do to the whole. Then they are the servants of an idea;
this once firmly fixed they distort all out-doors to fit it.
All evidence to confirm is at once admitted, while just
as quickly the door is shut in the face of whatever does
not go to prove their first and final conception to be
correct.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <a name="Single-Hander" id="Single-Hander"><img src="images/illus-053.jpg" width="600" height="496" alt="Single-Hander" /></a>
  <div class="figcaption">
    <p>Single-Hander</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Almost every man I know of who has contributed to
the literature of the single-hander has first sat by the
fireside and designed a craft and then built and sailed it
to prove that it is the only perfect thing.</p>

<p>Go over a fleet of this kind; what are they? Either
big toy boats or small copies of large vessels. While they
may perfectly fit the theory and be theoretically perfect,
they are practically of no use, or else inferior in many
ways to a boat of the same dimensions designed by experience.
The earliest types of these boats were closely
moulded upon the lines of fishing craft, being models
built to withstand the rough usage of that trade, and
suited to oar and sail alike. That a craft like this matured
in a rough locality is the best for its purpose is frequently
true, but that it is best for another purpose is as frequently
false.</p>

<p>This is an error common to many who have advocated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
some local type of boat for universal use. Having employed
it successfully in certain waters, they imperatively
assert that it will suit all waters, and having found it to
answer one purpose, they are equally certain that it will
answer all. It is the old story of the blind men and the
elephant&mdash;that of forming a compound conclusion from
a single observation.</p>

<p>If a man cruise, and cruise without assistance, the first
important thing is that his craft be one that he can handle
without excessive muscular strain. Therefore she must
not be heavy for her size, and her gear must be of such
weight as will readily permit of his working it. The
gear must be simple and of strength; the rig one that
needs the least attention. This is exactly what the typical
single-hander is not.</p>

<p>The typical single-hander is a coarse-lined, heavily
built craft, with complicated gear and divided canvas.
She is generally very full-bodied and badly overloaded
with ballast. Her initial stability is great, and her helm
action slow. This is the type of craft advocated by
nearly all who have written on this subject. One of the
prime virtues of this type in the eyes of single-hander
writers, is, that such craft are good sea boats. A few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
years ago boats of this description were more common
than they are to-day, but many are still afloat. The
favorite rig is that of cutter or yawl.</p>

<p>These boats are safe&mdash;that is, they seldom capsize&mdash;and
are good sea boats, if simple ability to float in rough
water constitutes a good sea; but they are slow, awkward
to handle, and utterly unable to make way in rough
water and heavy winds.</p>

<p>Off the wind in all weather they move slowly and
steer badly and in light breezes are logs. One of these
boats that I handled would yaw four points either way
when running off in a following sea, and when close-hauled
in a blow would lie down and sag off bodily to leeward.
It was utterly impossible to get her to windward
except under conditions of a smooth sea and steady
breeze, weather in which any vessel will do her best.</p>

<p>I remember once seeing a small cutter-rigged, single-hander
trying for several hours to beat round Matinicock
Point against a head sea and wind. This vessel,
which was built after the plans of a celebrated single-hander's
boat, was a failure on every point of sailing.
Another time we passed a small cutter off Saybrook; she
was jumping up and down and chopping waves at a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
great rate. Our consort, who had passed the same point
two hours before, reported speaking the yacht in almost
the same position, and no doubt she would be there yet
if the wind and tide had not shifted and lifted her in.</p>

<p>The essential element of safety in all vessels is the
power to move forward under all conditions of weather.
This is especially so of a sailing craft. There must also
be a perfect and rapid obedience to the helm. A slow-moving
or sluggish craft is a dangerous one. The smaller
the vessel the more true this is.</p>

<p>The other element of safety is the mobility of the rig.
The ability to make, reduce and shift sail rapidly is essential
to safety. This is only possible when the sails and
spars are proportioned to the strength of those manipulating
them, and the gear of the simplest and most direct
description. The over subdividing of canvas is bound to
complicate the gear; the keeping of the canvas in large
sails to make the spars heavy and unwieldy.</p>

<p>The most perfect type of boat and rig for one man to
handle is the cat&mdash;in theory; but in practice it fails in
many ways. If the weather was a constant it would be the
ideal rig. But winds are changeable things in all localities.
So long as a cat can carry her whole sail comfort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>ably she is the safest and most easily handled rig in
existence; but once reef her and she forfeits much of her
ability. Then again, in strong winds, she is a bad runner,
and her sail being large and well outboard she is
difficult to reef. For windward work under favorable
conditions the cat is unrivaled, and as a one-man boat
she is for some purposes without a peer. But I do not
recommend the rig for single-handed cruising.</p>

<p>Let us next consider the sloop. This is, except for
very small craft, an inferior rig for the purpose to the
cat, it having all the latter's faults without any other advantages
to compensate. In single-handers under 20
feet top measure the sloop rig will work very decently.
But it is decidedly inferior to the knockabout, for the
reason that in order to expand its canvas both the boom
and bowsprit must be carried outboard. This latter rig,
if kept down to reasonable proportions, is better than
either cat, sloop or cutter for single-handers under 30
feet top measure. But all these three rigs have the one
objectionable feature, that in order to reef the boat must
either leave her course or be hove-to while the operation
is performed, a serious disadvantage under rough conditions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>In a full-manned vessel, reefing, when the proper
method is employed, is a simple affair, but reefing by one
hand is always a long and troublesome job. If the vessel
cannot be kept on her course and is brought to the wind
the work is made much more difficult owing to the rolling
and pitching. Not only is this the case, but it is very
often dangerous to venture on a bowsprit at such a time
or to hang out over the stern in order to secure the
cringle-lashing. Any one who has reefed a jib when the
boat is head to the wind and pitching into a steep sea
will not deny this. Last summer in reefing down, owing
to the weight of the wind, I was obliged to take the sail
completely off my boat, as it was impossible to knot the
points with the canvas straining; losing her way, she fell
off into the trough of the sea, which was running very
large, and rolled so heavily that she threw all hands off
their feet. We could do nothing but hold on until at last
we were obliged to run her off under the peak and reef
her running. This manoeuvre cost us a good two miles
of hard-won weather gauge.</p>

<p>The three best rigs for single-man handling are the
ketch, yawl or sharpie, or double cat, as it is sometimes
called. The advantages of the yawl and ketch rig I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
explained in another chapter. The double cat is also fairly
good, but its chief objection is that the stepping of the
foremast in the eyes of the boat makes it close work forward
and the lack of a bowsprit increases the work of
handling the anchor.</p>

<p>As to the size of a single-hander. I have handled boats
of 35 feet, top measure alone, but it was labor; the
ground tackle for such a craft being a big lift for one
man. The only advantage of a long boat is the increased
speed and accommodation, but the latter is generally not
wanted.</p>

<p>I would recommend for this purpose a boat of not
over 30 feet&mdash;25 is better&mdash;and of either yawl or ketch rig.
A moderate sail plan, light spars and strong rigging,
the iron work especially being extra heavy. The hull,
while strongly built, should be clean-lined, and, above all,
stiff and weatherly. The last is the prime necessity. She
must be capable of going to windward under any set of
sail. At least half her ballast should be inside, firmly
secured. She should steer with a wheel.</p>

<p>We can summon all this up in one sentence, that will
concisely describe the ideal single-hander: A fast hull
and a small rig.</p>

<p class="subheader">ON SEAGOING BOATS</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> first and absolute necessity of a seagoing boat is
freeboard; the second is a complete deck and
water-tight openings. Given these two things and
you have an almost safe craft. There is no question of
capsizing a well-designed yacht of to-day by power of
the wind. Our outside ballasted boats cannot be kept
wrong side up, so long as the water is kept out of them.
They may be hove down on their sides and fill and sink,
but they cannot be turned completely over so long as
they retain their buoyancy. I have been in one of them,
a boat carrying only about half the usual weight of lead
for a vessel of her size, that was laid on her side in a
squall with both mainsail and jib in the water; she remained
in this position for nearly two minutes, and then
righted when the force of the squall was spent. Her lead
kept her from turning right over, and her large freeboard
kept her from edging down. She simply made a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
bottom of her side and floated on it. That is one advantage
of freeboard. Had she been a narrow-sided
boat she would have been forced between the pressure of
lead and wind deeper into the water, but as it was her
displacement, owing to the bearing up of the sail and
mast, was probably less when in that position than when
standing upright.</p>

<p>Again, freeboard increases the range of heel. This
is of enormous advantage when sailing in a sea way with
a strong breeze. The tripping power of the wave is exhausted
before the rail is brought down, and the boat not
receiving a load of water on her lee deck rights so much
quicker. A low-sided boat when canted by a beam sea
edges her rail under and shovels the water up on her
deck as she recovers. For this reason seagoing craft
should have their upper freeboard slightly tumbled home.
Bulwarks and high rails are bad things, and combings
should be kept well inboard, while raised cabin houses if
fitted should not be carried too close to the waterways.
Rails and bulwarks as far aft as the rigging can be raised
to an advantage, as they prevent the water from coming
in and not passing out. Water in breaking on board will
always follow along anything like the side of a house, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
when reaching a break spread in. This is how cockpits
are so easily filled. The height is suddenly cut down
from house to combing, and the sea having become
crowded up to the height of the house in its passage aft,
when it comes to the low place rushes into the cockpit.
If the combing is carried up to the height of the house
the water will pass along and go out over the stern.</p>

<p>Ballasted boats should never go into rough water
unless they have water-tight cockpits and water-tight
companions and openings. But a water-tight cockpit,
unless it is well-scuppered and really self-bailing, is of
little use. In eight out of ten small yachts the cockpits
are not, although they pretend to be, self-bailing. They
will bail perfectly when at anchor. In order to bail
quickly the floor must be at least ten inches above the
load water line. Here again freeboard comes in. Again,
the placing of the scuppers in the forward end of the
cockpit and their outboard openings under the bilge is
decidedly wrong. In the first place it keeps the water at
all times in the forward end of the standing room against
the cabin, just where you move about; in the second
every drop that goes out through the lee pipe has to
force its way against a pressure. This pressure is also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a><br /><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
constantly driving the water up and into the boat. The
place for the scuppers is aft with the openings under
the stern. Here there is constant suction so long as the
boat is moving ahead, no matter to which side or how
far she heels. Again, if the floor is sloped aft, whatever
water is on the standing room will run aft and be out of
the way, a measure of comfort that those who sail in
rough water can appreciate. It is not generally known
but a boat going at speed of four knots and over will, if
equipped with proper scuppers, siphon, i. e., suck the
water out.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

  <div class="figcaption">
    <p>A Seagoing Boat</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Another bad practice of builders is to put stationary
seats around a cockpit with lockers beneath them. This
never should be done. You cannot keep them tight, the
wood being constantly subject to water and sun. Never
put lockers of any kind in a boat with outboard openings.
Another bad practice is that of putting in low companion
thresholds. The threshold of the companion should be
as high or higher than the side of the boat, and should
on no account, no matter how high the cockpit floor is,
be on a level with it. The usual manner of constructing
companion doors is also open to objection. The new
method in which the door slides down into a recess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
through a rubber-packed joint is far better than the old
way of closing. Such a door can be made absolutely
water-tight, and can be opened without being opened.
This enables you to see into the cabin or out of it without
running the slide back or risking getting a wash
below by opening the doors. These may seem trivial
details, but it is the neglect of such to whose account the
loss of the majority of seagoing vessels must be placed.
Poor hatches and low, badly protected engine room skylights
are responsible for nearly all the steamships that
go to sea, and are never heard of again. Keep the water
out and you can live out anything in the way of sea or
wind. Let it get in and everything that before made
your craft seaworthy will be an aid to your ending. Your
ballast will be a weight to sink you, and the empty space
that gave you buoyancy so much room to quickly fill
with water.</p>

<p>After this, look to your pump. Where is it? In most
yachts directly amidships, drawing out of a well over the
lowest part of the keel. Where should it be? In the
place where it can be used when most wanted&mdash;the bilge.
You must have a means of drawing from the center, so
you can pump out when at anchor or sailing upright.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
But all pumps should have a bilge intake. It would be
a very simple matter to make such a connection with a
cock to cut off the other intakes. How often, when he
least wants to, has a man to let his boat up, so as to get
the water amidships for the purpose of pumping it out.
If he could pump from the bilges this coming up would
be unnecessary. To kill a boat's way in a heavy beam
or head sea, so as to get her on her keel, is a dangerous
artifice; but it must be done with the pump amidships, if
you want to get the water out, and keep a dry cabin.
Every seagoing small yacht should have at least two
fixed pumps, and a movable one. The fixed pumps
should be constantly looked to, and the limbers kept
clean. Never stow inside weight alongside of or over
the intake, and never allow rubbish to be swept into the
spaces between the floors. With a good pump a man
can keep down all the water that will work into a tight
boat through her bottom, topsides and deck.</p>

<p>All seagoing yachts should have the rudder post
boxed up and carried well above the water line. The
neglect of this is the cause of much leakage. She should
also have in her rudder blade a boring or rod in which
to make fast emergency lines or chains. In craft that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
have their rudders well under them a rod must be used,
but in shallow boats with broad blades a hole bored
through the outer edge will do. These lines are extremely
useful when anchored in a sea way; by hauling them
taut over either quarter you can relieve the strain on the
head of the post and gear attached to it. In case of a
breakdown of the quadrant, wheel or post head, you can
at once take control of the rudder and keep the boat
under command.</p>

<p>No boat should go into rough water for a long run unless
she have ringbolts aft for the purpose of passing
boom lashings, and also a fixed boom crotch, or at least
one that can be made immovable. There is no other way
of keeping a boom steady when the sail is lowered down.
You cannot by any possible means do so with lashings,
unless you can horn it in a crotch. A loose boom is a
constant menace. Provision also should be made for
the trysail sheets, and for body lashings for the crew, and
lashings for the boat, even if you have davits. The principal
weak spot in the rigging of a boat that is to be
driven in heavy water is the bobstay. That piece of rigging
is often carried away in a sea than any other, and
usually it is the bolt that goes. Look to it, and look to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
it well; for if it parts, most likely you will lose your mast.
The only safeguard lies in rigging a preventer stay that
will set up with a tackle, the fall leading inboard. The
stay should be of wire rope properly and strongly secured
to the stem. Use either a gun tackle or luff tackle&mdash;the
latter is preferable&mdash;and be sure to give it plenty of
drift. When in use, set it up just scant of the strain, so
that if the bobstay parts it will catch the strain before the
spar gets a good spring. In boats that have a forestay
set up to the stem head there is less likelihood of this accident
happening; but it is always best to have a preventer
fitted. Make the fall fast around the bitts or mast
where you can readily get at it, and hold a turn to set
it up. Seagoing boats should have two shrouds on a
side and set up with lanyards in preference to rigging
screws. If you fit the latter, have them about twice the
size of those ordinarily put on by riggers. She should
also have a heavy set of masthead runners and duplicate
eyes to set them up to, one pair being placed well aft.
Our modern full-bowed boats are very hard on their
rigging and spars when in a sea way, and need to be
heavily ironed.</p>

<p>Outside of her ordinary sails a seagoing yacht needs a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
trysail, a small square sail, and a small jib or staysail, all
made of heavy canvas. Particular attention should be paid
to the roping and clews of these sails. It is of no use
using heavy canvas if the clew irons are frail and the
rope light. A gaff-headed trysail is better than a jib-headed,
but it is more bother to set. Care should be
taken to see that the cleat or ringbolt for the trysail
sheet is in such a position as will allow the sail to be
properly sheeted, for a trysail when used for riding must
set flat, or else it will bang itself to pieces.</p>

<p>In seagoing craft looks don't count, and therefore be
not afraid to make all your rigging heavy and strong, and
wherever possible have a fitting or tackle that can be instantly
made to take the place of one that carries away.
Always when in rough water or in heavy weather keep
a vang or down-haul on the peak of the gaff. It is sometimes
the only thing that will bring the sail down, and it
gives you command of the spar, especially when the
yacht is rolling heavily. The chafing of gear when in a
sea way is constant and ruinous. To prevent it a close
watch must be kept on all ropes where they pass through
blocks or lie against spars or other ropes. If your hal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>liards and sheet remain long in one place they must be
canvased or armored with some sort of chafing stuff.</p>

<p>One more important thing. Whenever you get far
from land, lash the oars and rudder in the dingey. Then
put in a good long coil of light line, a bucket, a jug or
breaker of water, and enough food to last for a day or
two. Lash these in so they cannot get out. Many a life
has been lost and many a man has suffered horribly because
these simple precautions have been neglected.
Something suddenly happens to the yacht; it is a case of
boat at once. The crew throw the boat over and jump
in. Too late they find that the oars are gone or that
there is no water or food. The bucket and rope are for
use as a sea anchor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p class="chapterintro">"The present tendency of canvasing is to increase the
number of sails on cruising yachts, and to decrease on
racing craft. Experience teaches that in both cases we
are doing the right thing. Ultimate speed is found in
single sails; ease of handling, safety and mobility in
divided sail."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p class="subheader">ON RIGS</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">In</span> discussing rigs suitable for cruising we may at once
dismiss from consideration several that are in common
use, but which are not adapted for service in
our waters, or are distinctly inferior by reason of being
difficult to handle with small and unskillful crews. We
will, also, dismiss the true cutter rig from our considerations,
as it has almost passed out of use, its place being
taken by the modern type of single-sticker, which is part
cutter and part sloop. This combination rig is not in its
full sparring suitable for boats under forty feet, but when
stripped of the topmast it is in some ways an excellent
type.</p>

<p>We can also drop the cat, and what is called the cat-yawl,
from our list. The four rigs to which I shall call
your attention are the pole-mast sloop, yawl, ketch and
schooner.</p>

<p>The pole-mast sloop, of which the knockabout is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
commoner specimen, is an excellent rig for use on a
cruiser. The difference between the sloop proper and
the knockabout is in the method of spreading the canvas;
in the sloop the canvas is spread fore-and-aft, a
large percentage being forward of the mast; in the
knockabout the much greater part of the spread is in the
mainsail, and the hoist is higher. The tall, narrow-peaked
mainsail of the latter is its characteristic feature. The
jib is small and tacked down to the stem head.</p>

<p>The disadvantage of this rig is that sufficient canvas
to drive a heavy, full-bodied boat cannot be spread; consequently,
a true knockabout is a comparatively roomless
craft.</p>

<p>The false knockabout, a bastard craft that is becoming
very common, is one in which the sail area is increased
by extending the headsail on a bowsprit, and running
the boom outboard.</p>

<p>The pole-mast sloop has many warm advocates, and is
without question a far better rig than the old sloop,
hampered with topmast and lofty gear, but it shares with
all single-masted vessels the faults that are common to
the type. The most serious of these is, that you cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
shorten sail except by reefing. This can be done with
the yawl, ketch and schooner rigs.</p>

<p>I have heard many men, and men of experience, decry
the yawl rig, giving as their opinion that it is inferior in
every way to the short-rigged sloop. But I have generally
found that these men have formed their judgment
from the actions of one boat, and that failing to confirm
preconceived opinions they have condemned the type,
root, bole and branch.</p>

<p>In an article upon the yawl rig, written some time back,
I explained one of the reasons why this rig came into
favor, and why it has lost favor with many who at first
highly valued it. I cannot do better than reprint these
remarks:</p>

<p>It has been said that the worst enemy a man can have
is his best friend. Howsoever this may be in the world
of men, it is most certainly so in the world of things, and
nowhere has unmeasured eulogy of the best friend
wrought greater havoc than in the case of the yawl rig.
Unfortunately for the yawl rig, it has been repeatedly
chosen to drive the craft of the writing lonesome sailor,
and consequently it has figured to a marked degree in
yachting literature, and as these writers have lavished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a><br /><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
upon it page upon page of unqualified praise, the effect
has been to lift the rig into a singular and prominent
position, and to surround it with a glamour not the less
charming because a sparkle of truth concentrates and
enhances its delusive glitter.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p>There is no question but what narratives like those
penned by the famous single-hand sailor McMillan were
the cause of the yawl's sudden elevation to favor in
American waters, and there is no question but what
some books are responsible for much of the fabulous that
envelopes the rig. There are few of us who would be
ready to swallow all that a lover might say in praise of
his mistress, and yet a man is just as likely to magnify
the points and virtues of his vessel as he is those of his
Dulcinea; therefore we cannot be too careful in accepting
the evidence of the infatuated yachtsman or in
adopting his finding as infallible precedents. For, often
carried away by the good behavior of his craft, he
jumps at a conclusion, attributing to one quantity that
which should be adjudged to the fabric as a whole. This
is often the case; and again, too frequently is the rig of
the vessel blamed for results which are the sum of defects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span> altogether foreign to a peculiar sparring and canvasing.</p>

<p>The unqualified praise which has been lavished on the
yawl rig has, as is usual, awakened a no less unqualified
storm of dispraise. While the yawlman has, with that
noble effrontery which distinguishes the true crank,
claimed for his favorite rig everything in sight, the recalcitrant
unbeliever has as broadly denied it, even those
common virtues which one supposed to be possessed by
even the meanest and most primitive craft.</p>

<p>I have no hesitancy in saying that so far as the driving
value of the mizzen is concerned it is an unimportant
quantity. This is especially so when on the wind. On
most of the yawls I have handled there has been good
cause for this. In the first place, the boomkins were too
short, and the other spars too light. You cannot
expect a sail to sit properly and hold its draught on
buckling spars. The lead of the sheet is such that the
boom cannot be kept rigid, and just as soon as it blows
its end turns up like a pugdog's tail, throwing the canvas
all out of shape. Then the back-wind from the mainsail
makes it impossible to keep the mizzen full unless it is
sheeted very flat. On yawls with gaff-headed mizzens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a><br /><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
the mast is frequently too short; consequently the head
of the sail cannot be kept in place. With jib-headed
mizzens the same spar is too light; in consequence when
the sheet is brought down hard the mast buckles aft,
throwing the head of the sail into a bag. How frequently
you see a yawl on the wind with her mizzen all a-shiver.
If you make the boomkin longer, the boom stouter, and
give the mast a good head, you will get a better sitting
and more efficient sail.</p>

<p>Now let us, in order to test the qualities of short-rigged
sloop and yawl, place them in such situations as they are
liable to get into when cruising. First they are caught
in a heavy, sudden blow with a lee shore close aboard.
It is necessary to shorten sail at once. The yawl simply
lowers her mainsail and, holding way under mizzen and
jib, forereaches along, while the crew, having secured
the boom, proceed to tie in the reefs. The sloop is in
such a situation that she cannot run off; she must either
anchor, lower everything and drift, or else jolly along with
head sheets flowed and the peak of the mainsail up.
Having a part of the mainsail drawing increases the difficulty
of reefing, and if there is any sea the lowering of the
sail will cause her to roll, making it bad work securing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
the clew. The yawl's clew is inboard, where it can be
readily handled, and owing to her jib and mizzen sheets
being aft she is comparatively steady.</p>

<p>Again, we will suppose that both these boats have
come to anchor, sails stowed and awnings up. It comes
on to blow, and it is necessary to shift berth to a more
secure anchorage. The yawl hoists her jib and mizzen&mdash;a
very easy matter&mdash;and beats up to a better anchorage.
The sloop has to take in her awning, clear decks and perhaps
reef the mainsail before hoisting it to follow. How
many times has the cruising man remained in an uncomfortable
berth because of the labor of making sail on his
sloop after all has been snugged down?</p>

<p>Now let us suppose these two boats are running off
large, with a steep sea and heavy wind. The yawl takes
in her mizzen and lets her boom broad off, its short
length preventing the danger of tripping. The sloop
has no mizzen to take in, but it has a long boom which
must be watched carefully or else topped-up. And with
a strong beam wind the yawl with jib and mizzen stowed
will ratch along under reefed mainsail; very few sloops
will do that.</p>

<p>One time when coming down along shore with a yawl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
we had an unsteady northwest wind, blowing a good
whole-sail breeze, with now and again tremendous heavy
puffs, acting as wind off land frequently does. We made
company with a sloop of about our own size, but a much
faster boat. In the puffs it was necessary for both of us
to let up, but the rest of the time we could carry our canvas
without worrying. I put two hands on the main sheet
with orders to spill the sail when a puff struck, and, keeping
on my course, shivered her through. The sloop man
first tried luffing out, but, losing distance by this, he resorted
to starting sheet and bearing off; consequently he
was all over the shop. Once or twice he had to drop his
peak in order to keep control. Neither of us wanted to
get offshore, as we had to haul up at the next point, so
were hugging the beach rather close. At last he gave in,
anchored and started to reef. We followed suit, but kept
on our course under jib and mizzen, getting a two-mile
lead and first home. He came aboard that evening and
asked me what kind of yawl his sloop would make. As
he flicked the oakum out of us the next day in a beat to
windward I am afraid he didn't stay converted, but relapsed
into the sloop heresy.</p>

<p>The ketch rig, which is very like the yawl, has all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
latter's virtues and defects and a few of its own. The
difference between the ketch and the yawl is this: in the
yawl the mizzen-mast is stepped abaft the rudder post,
and in the ketch forward of it. In the ketch this brings
the mast just where it is most in the way, right at the
forward end of the cockpit, generally obliging the putting
of the companion on one side, or else taking the hatch
well forward to the middle of the cabin. The ketch mainsail
is narrow-footed, and longer on the hoist than that
of the yawl. It is a very light and easy rig to handle, and
for large boats is better than the yawl; and for small ones
it is better than the schooner. In this country it is mostly
used on shallow, flat-bottomed hulls, such as are employed
in navigating Southern waters. In the British
Isles it is a favorite rig for coasters, and I have heard it
highly commended by coastwise skippers. Most of the
sloops formerly used in that trade have been in late years
converted into ketches. The most marked advantage it
has over the yawl is that, if the largest sail be taken in,
there is left in the head sails and mizzen a good spread
of canvas; whereas, if the mainsail be taken off a yawl
she is under too short sail to do satisfactory work. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
advantage the ketch has over the schooner is in getting
rid of the long main boom.</p>

<p>Like the catboat, if the weather were a constant quantity,
the schooner would be a rig without peer. In
smooth water and when she can carry her sail, especially
to windward, there is no rig to equal the schooner. She
has the speed and weatherliness of the sloop, with lighter
and easier sails to handle. She can be shortened down
without reefing, and can spread plenty of light canvas in
soft winds. Her defect is the defect of all fore-and-afters,
although in her case it is aggravated by having the mainmast
stepped further aft&mdash;she is a bad runner in heavy
water.</p>

<p>I have made a passage of twelve days in a schooner,
during which time we never had the stops off the mainsail;
during part of the time having no after-sail, and the
rest of the time a trysail set. To have set the mainsail
and squared off the boom would surely have brought
about a disaster.</p>

<p>Let me here repeat some former remarks on the subject:
It is often a matter of wonder to landsmen why
sailors continue to use square sails, when to all intents
the fore-and-aft canvas is so much easier to handle. So<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a><br /><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
it is in smooth water and under average conditions; so
long as one of our typical fore-and-aft schooners can
carry all sail and make progress in a windward direction
there is no abler vessel afloat. But when obliged to
shorten down or make a run for it, they are the worst
craft in the world. So long as you can keep sail on them
they will do all that a ship can be asked to do, but once
they are stripped in a gale, good-bye to safety. Take a
good look at an ordinary two-masted coaster, and you
will comprehend at once why this is. These vessels have
enormously long lower masts, and the spread of the rigging
is in consequence small; their booms are long and
heavy, and all the weight above deck is centered in a line
over the keel. The pressure of canvas, except when the
sails are winged, is all on one side, and is exerted so as
to bring a twisting strain upon the supporting spars.
There is not, as in the square-rigger, a balancing of
weights and strains. The freer these vessels are sailing
the more pronounced is this strain. The only relief the
spar can find is to impart this strain to the hull, which in
consequence forces the bow in the opposite direction and
brings a pressure upon the helm. To prevent this action
a reducing of the after canvas is necessary.</p>

<p>A close study of the fore-and-aft rigs used along our
coast will show what devices have been resorted to in
order to remedy this defect. In the first place, there was
the subdividing of the mainsail&mdash;making a three-master;
then a gradual reduction of the spanker, until on many
of our three-masted schooners it is to-day the smallest
of the three lower sails. At the same time the lower
masts have been shortened and the hoists of the topsails
increased. On the great lakes the fresh-water man has
reduced his spanker to almost the proportions of a ketch's
mizzen, the necessity of more constant jibing having
forced him to this change. But alter as you please, the
fore-and-after is still a bad runner when winds blow
strong and seas run high.</p>

<p>Our modern racing schooners are a particularly bad
type. They are really large sloops with a fake foresail,
this latter bit of canvas being more ornamental than useful.
A good specimen of the rig proper are some of our
large cruising schooners, with wide-footed foresails and
short main booms. The pilot-boat and fisherman rigs
are also excellent types.</p>

<p>In a proper schooner the foresail should be in such a
position as to allow the vessel to be handled under it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
alone, as it is the last sail to take off in heavy weather.
It should be broad-footed in order to trim properly; you
cannot trim a narrow-footed foresail so as to draw when
going to windward unless it has a lug; this lug is a nuisance,
as it obliges the tending of the sheet when tacking.
The main boom should not go over the taffrail beyond
easy reach. A forty-foot pole-mast schooner makes a
very handy boat for two men to work. Her heaviest sail
is lighter than the heaviest sail of a yawl or ketch of the
same size. This is something you must always take into
consideration when choosing a rig for cruising. The
average yachtsman is a man who does not do manual
labor for a living, and is consequently soft-muscled.
Handling sails, unless you are constantly at it, is hard
labor, and if a boat is short-handed is sometimes a heavy
tax on the strength of the crew. Any one who has
hoisted a heavy mainsail by himself will understand this.
Many a time after making sail or reefing when alone I
have lain down completely exhausted.</p>

<p>A man who intends to employ a crew can afford to
ignore this question, as he can suit his crew to his boat;
but when you depend upon amateurs for help you cannot
do so. One day you may have a double watch, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
next day nobody. So it is best to select a rig of such
weight as you can handle yourself if necessary. This
makes you to a certain extent independent of your
friends.</p>

<p class="subheader">ON SAIL AS AN AUXILIARY</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">One</span> day, while standing talking to a builder, we
were joined by the owner of a naphtha launch
who was desirous of having his vessel rigged as
a yawl, and had come to get the builder's opinion as to
what the change would accomplish and cost. In response
to an inquiry as to what speed he might expect
to get out of the craft under canvas, the builder answered,
"four miles." "Then," replied the owner in jubilant
tones, "she will go eleven miles, as I get seven out of her
now without any sail." He was greatly surprised, and
rather suspicious of our knowledge, when we informed
him that if sail increased the speed of his craft over her
maximum to the extent of half-a-mile an hour, he might
consider himself fortunate. Now, this man is by no
means a lone bird in his belief; he shares the misconception
with many launch-owners and others. Like some of
our popular authors who write sea stories that are not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
sea stories, the average man firmly believes that steamships
can and do sail, and it will take many years of
pounding to get this idea out of the public's head. There
are afloat steam vessels that can and do sail, but they
are sailing vessels equipped with engines. In former
times almost all ocean-going steam craft could work to
leeward under canvas, but they, unlike the vessel of to-day,
were heavily rigged, most of them carrying full sets
of yards forward, and spreading many thousand feet of
cloth. The steam vessel of this age, when put to using
sail, simply drifts. Except as a check to rolling, the sails
carried by steam vessels are of little use.</p>

<p>Now, to the question of what use is sail as an auxiliary
power. In vessels of a speed exceeding ten knots, it is
of little or no use, except when due to the form of the
hull, or for other reasons the slip of the screw is excessive.
As, for instance, in a vessel towing others, such as
sea-going tugs, where the actual speed is one-half of the
screw speed, sail is an aid. Again, in a vessel of bad
form, when, frequently owing to the weight on the engine
it is unable to run at its highest working speed, sail
is an aid, as it lifts some of the weight off the engine,
and allows an increase of revolutions without an in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>crease of fuel expenditure. For this purpose, fore-and-aft
canvas is of doubtful utility, the square sail being far
better. But in high-powered, fine-lined vessels auxiliary
sail is of no use whatever. The little that might be
gained by employing it under the most favorable circumstances
is offset by the retarding effect of the windage
under unfavorable circumstances.</p>

<p>A vessel whose screw speed is eight knots and whose
actual speed is six knots has a slip of twenty-five per
cent. Supposing that her sail power is sufficient to drive
her five knots or three knots in excess of the slip. Now,
if her speed be increased to eleven knots by using canvas,
it must not only take up the slip, but induce an acceleration
of the engine, so as to give an additional screw
speed of three knots&mdash;an increase of 37½ per cent. over
the working speed of the engine. This is practically impossible.
No engine is built to run at a speed of 37½
per cent. over its working speed, yet unless the screw
travels as fast as the hull, it is useless. It is exactly the
same thing as when trying to row a boat running under
sail; unless you move the oars faster through the water
than the boat is moving you do not assist in the propulsion.
Reasoning from this, we may lay it down as an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
axiom, that: When a vessel's maximum speed under
power exceeds her maximum speed under canvas, the
use of sail in conjunction with power will not increase
the speed beyond the percentage of slip.</p>

<p>When mechanical propulsion is the auxiliary power,
we have a different problem. Take a vessel capable of
being driven by sail at a speed of eight knots, and by her
engines alone at four knots. Now, if she be sailing at
a speed of eight knots, and we start her engine to make
the number of revolutions necessary to induce a speed of
four knots, the screw, not traveling as fast as the hull,
will be dragged to the amount of the difference between
its speed and the speed of the boat&mdash;four knots. In that
the screw shall have a propulsive force it must be driven
at a speed to exceed eight knots, an increase of over 100
per cent. Reasoning from this, we may lay it down as
an axiom, that: A vessel whose maximum speed under
sail exceeds her maximum speed under power will not
increase her speed by employing sail and screw conjointly.</p>

<p>While auxiliary sail is of little or no value, auxiliary
mechanical propulsion is. But its chief value lies in it as
a substitute, and not as an auxiliary. The wind&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
fuel of the sail&mdash;is not only a variable quantity, but frequently
an absent one. A small vessel, such as are the
majority of our cruising yachts, seldom exceeds a speed
of eight knots, and as a general average taken through a
summer's cruising do not log more than four, much of
this low average is due to the hours spent in calms and
light airs; and if we add the time lost in waiting for a
breeze, the average will fall still lower. A yacht in sailing
100 miles in the usual summer weather takes, we will
say, twenty-five hours. Sixty miles of this is made in a
fair breeze in ten hours, then six hours in which she
makes ten miles, leaving nine hours in which to make the
other thirty.</p>

</table>

<p>Let us suppose that a similar craft is fitted with a
motor to drive her at a speed of five miles an hour. She
voyages 100 miles, the first sixty in ten hours. During
the doldrums she uses her power for six hours, and
makes thirty miles, and in sixteen hours has covered
ninety miles against the sail yacht's seventy. Having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
made the distance at an average speed of 5&#8541; miles, she
is within sight of her port when the other is thirty miles
off.</p>

<p>Last summer I ran thirty-eight miles in fourteen
hours in a small sloop. Thirty-two miles of this distance
was made in eight hours, the remaining six miles taking
six hours to cover, and if you analyze a set of cruising
runs you will see that mine was an exceptionally good
performance. I usually, in cruising, figure on making
an average of three miles, thirty miles being a fair day's
work and forty a good one, while a fifty-mile run is possible
only once or twice during the season. This is in a
boat whose maximum speed is seven knots.</p>

<p>I have not the slightest doubt but what a man with a
yacht fitted with a motor capable of driving her at a speed
of five miles, and using the engine only as a substitute
for sail when the wind is dead or fickle, could cruise
twice as far and see twice as much as one who depended
solely upon canvas. This is a deal to promise, but no
doubt those who have had a long experience in cruising
in our Eastern waters will underwrite the opinion.</p>

<p>But while auxiliary power has its advantages, it also
has its disadvantages. It increases the expense; it takes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
up room in the boat; it is noisy, and, to a certain extent,
disagreeable, due mostly to the use of a fuel which is not
equal, odoriferously speaking, to genuine wood violets.
But its chief drawback is that its use tends to make
cruising less toilsome and hazardous. Like all modern

<br /><span style="margin-left: 2em; font-size: smaller;">"Inventions that save our seamen's lives,<br /></span>
<span style="margin-left: 2em; font-size: smaller;">And murder the breed of sailor men,"<br /></span>

its effect is to discount skill and pluck, to take away from
voyaging that uncertainty which is the chief charm of the
cruiser's existence. The fact that you leave port with a
certainty of getting to your destination on time, barring
accidents, makes somewhat monotonous an event that
otherwise containing a large element of chance induces a
corresponding degree of excitement. There is probably
no pastime so tiresome to an active man as steam yachting,
especially if it be in familiar waters. A steam yacht
is a lazy man's palace and an active man's prison. Except
when there is a race or a difficult bit of navigation,
I would as soon run a trolley car as a power boat. But,
then, happily for the world, we are not all taken off the
same molds. Many men yacht for pleasure, and find
such pleasure in idleness. I don't. I find my pleasure
in physical exertion, and in opposing what skill and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
knowledge I may possess to the task of getting the better
of the elements. But as age and rheumatism tighten
their grip, my heart is being gradually weaned from the
sail, and I find myself thinking seriously, if, after all, it
will not be better to have a little power under the deck
to fall back on at certain times.</p>

<p class="subheader">ON REEFING</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">This</span> is a short chapter on a short subject, but one
that is of interest to the green hand. Men often
ask when it is time to reef? It is always time to reef
when you think it is. The moment you would feel easier
and your boat handle better by having less sail spread,
is the time to shorten down. Never mind what anybody
else is doing or what anybody else tells you. It is your
boat, not some other boat that is worrying, and yourself,
and not some other person, who is in charge. Never
carry sail for the sake of carrying it; the ignorant may
praise your recklessness and pluck, but the experienced
man will call you either a lubber or a fool.</p>

<p>Never let the action of another guide you in this particular,
unless the action agrees with your own judgment.
It is very common for young sailors to reef or not reef
as they see some other man, and consequently to carry
sail much to the risk of their vessel and lives. You must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
remember that these remarks of mine have nothing to do
with racing. In racing, a man cannot reef when he wants
to, but when he can; therefore, he frequently carries sail
when he would give a good slice of his daily income to have
it off, and often keeps in his reefs when he would like to
shake them out, but does not for the same reason. Then,
again, in racing, boats are always in company, and if an
accident happens someone is close aboard to give assistance;
but in cruising this is not so, and many a life
has been lost for want of a reef in time.</p>

<p>When I was young and fresh I had an idea that if anyone
could carry sail on a boat I could do the same. One
day I had a lesson that made me think, and partially
cured me of the habit. I went with a clever old boatman
across the Sound to bring home a new cat. We each
took a crew, and, to return, he sailed the new boat, and
I the one we had come over in. Halfway across it came
on to blow very hard, and it was all I could do to keep
my boat on her feet. My crew wanted me to stop and
reef, but as the new boat kept on, I insisted upon following
her, being afraid that the old man would laugh at me.
In plain talk, I was afraid of being thought a coward,
and for this I jeopardized my own and the lives of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
other boys. When at last, after a struggle and half full
of water, we reached port, the old man met me with a
torrent of invectives, calling me a fool and several other
hard names for not reefing.</p>

<p>"But you didn't reef," I protested. "Reef!" he exclaimed.
"No, for I couldn't; but I'd given fourteen
dollars if I could have got that sail down. Do you think
I was carrying whole sail for fun?" It seems the halliards,
being new, had jammed, and they could not
get the sail down, so had to lug it. This taught me a
lesson, one that I have never forgotten; and oftentimes
when I see a man struggling along under too much sail,
I wonder if he, like the old boatman, wouldn't give fourteen
dollars if he could get that sail down.</p>

<p>The first thing when you get a crew is to break them
in to a method of reefing. Give each man a place and
teach him to keep it; this is the secret of rapid and
efficient work. Let us suppose that you are in command
of a small sloop, with a total crew of four. It comes on
to blow, and you decide to reef. There is a bit of lee
under the shore, and you go in for it. Now you have
decided to reef without anchoring, and when close
enough luff up and prepare to lower the mainsail. Your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
mate, your best hand, and the man in his watch go to the
halliards, you stay at the helm and your watch-mate
takes the sheet.</p>

<p>Now, if you lower the mainsail all the way down, you
will have to take in your headsail and drift; this will soon
take you out of your kindly lee, but if you can keep some
after-sail up, with the jib on an easy sheet, you can jolly
her up to windward a bit and keep close inshore. Having
decided on this you order the sail lowered down to
the reef. The getting down of the sail quickly depends
on your cleverness at the helm; you must spill just at the
right moment. As the sail comes down your two men
handle and lay the sail along the boom, the mate tending
the halliards. When the tack cringle is low enough
he belays the halliards and ties down the tack. By this
time you have the pendant ready, and when the mate
shouts "All fast," you haul out, one man helping you and
the others shaking and lighting out the canvas. When
this is handed out and made fast, the hands begin to tie
the points, beginning in the middle and working forward
and aft.</p>

<p>Your business is to look after the dog-ear, to tie in
the outboard points, and pass a lashing round the clew,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
wrapping it round the boom. The points are passed
between the foot of the sail and the lacing, not between
the lacing and the boom, a common error with green
hands. Tie your points with a square bow knot; don't
tie them too tight; try and put the same strain on all.
Don't haul out your clew too hard, especially if it is raining
or the water is flying. The pendant will shrink one
way, the sail the other, and in consequence the canvas
be pulled out of life. As soon as all the points are tied,
look them over carefully to see that they belong to the
proper reef, and are not tied cross-faced, and, if correct,
hoist away.</p>

<p>Lazy-jacks on a boom are of great assistance in taking
a sail in, but they are in the way when reefing. Quarter-lifts
as substitutes are better for small craft. The reef
points should be made of different kinds of stuff, or else
be dyed different colors, so as to be easily distinguishable.
I prefer different kinds of stuff, as they can be told
by the feel at night. The first reef being cotton line, the
second manila, and the third cotton.</p>

<p>If you are going to tie in more than one reef, it is best
to tie in the first, then the next over it, and so on. This
also makes a much neater looking job. Teach your men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
to roll the sail up tightly before tying in; nothing looks
so bad as a reef made up of a series of bags.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

  <div class="figcaption">
    <p>The Proper Way to Tie Reef-Points</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>If you are caught out in the open, and have to reef, it
is best to lower all down and reef running off; by getting
the boom firmly lashed amidships you can handle the
sail, whereas if you lay-to the sea will make trouble. In
running off carefully tend your helm, and keep the vessel
moving, or you may get pooped. If anywhere near
shore it is best to go in, anchor and reef in quiet, and at
your leisure. The methods of reefing a sloop are the
same for reefing a cat, but if you have a yawl, ketch or
schooner, the work is much more simple and easy.</p>

<p>Always, when anchored in an open roadstead, or in
any place where you may have to get out in a hurry, reef
your large sails before turning in. Then, if it comes on
to blow in the night, you are ready for it. If you expect
a squall to hit you, in a place where you cannot anchor,
reef down, and do so in plenty of time. Before leaving
harbor, if there is any question of weather outside, reef
and carry them out with you, until you get the heft of the
breeze; if it is lighter than you expected, it is a simple
job to shake out.</p>

<p>Reefed jibs are not much use; they seldom work well,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
and it is far better to shift headsails than to reef them.
The jibs should be snap-hooked on the stay; in this way
they can be quickly shifted. Reefing on a bowsprit in a
seaway is a difficult and dangerous job. I shall speak
further of this matter of head-sails in another chapter.</p>

<p class="subheader">ON ANCHORS AND ANCHORING</p>

<p>One of man's oldest, simplest and most perfect instruments&mdash;the
anchor. Like all early inventions,
it obtained its present form by a slow process
of evolution, and, as is the case with nearly all implements
of the same nature, it is to-day to be found in
use in every step-form which during the gradual process
of development it assumed. The primal anchor of
stone is still universally employed, its immediate successors,
the stone-weighted net and log, are yet in use in
the East, and iron forms that might have found their
shape under the hammer blows of the sinewy Sidonian
smiths still swing from the bows of vessels plying the
Indian seas.</p>

<p>As to who first forged anchors of iron there is some
doubt, the ancient historians disagreeing on this point with
amiable unanimity that characterizes all their statements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
in regard to the origin of things, both animate and inanimate.
The balance of evidence appears to favor the
Phrygians, a people of Asia Minor, whose most celebrated
king, Midas, is well remembered as the avaricious
monarch who had the unfortunate experience with gold,
as related in a yarn which probably originated in the
imaginative brain of some ancient free-silver orator.</p>

<p>But whether these people or their contemporaries, the
ingenious, rich and daring Phoenicians, first forged it,
there is no question but what iron anchors were originally
used by the maritime nations inhabiting the shore of the
great tideless sea. The anchors were, as I have said, of
stone and of wood weighted with stone and metal, such
as are still used by the Chinese and Malays. It is easy
to see how from the latter came the shape of the anchor
of to-day. From the use of a straight balk of timber to
one with a crook is a natural step. It is much easier to
lash a stone to a crook of wood by placing it between
the trunk and branch than it is to lash it to a straight
stick.</p>

<p>Evidence favors this as the step of progression; the
first iron anchors having but one arm and no stock; being
simply the wooden crook reproduced in metal. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
next step was to add the bill or point, which very readily
took its shape from the spear of that day or the spade,
both of which implements were arrow-shaped. The next
step forward was the adding of the second arm. The
arms of ancient anchors were straight, not curved, as
are the anchors of to-day. The curved arm being very
modern. With the stock added, when and by whom it is
not known, the anchor of the ancients continued to do
its duty until early in the last century, when an Englishman
named Pering greatly improved it by curving the
arms and strengthening the crown and shank. At the
same time the trip-hammer came into use for forging,
allowing of a far more perfect welding of material than
could be secured with hand-swung sledges.</p>

<p>In order to understand the action of the anchor, which
is perfect, it is only necessary to take the common pick,
such as is employed by laborers in breaking up earth,
and drive it into solid ground. Drive the arm of your
pick right to the helve; now pull on it at right angles to
the arm. You cannot move it; nor could the strongest
man; simply lift the handle up and the arm will come
out of the ground easily. Such is the action of the anchor.
Is anything more simple or perfect?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>When out ahead this small arm will hold a great ship
against wind and tide; when brought under foot it is
broken from its hold by half a dozen men. An anchor
weighing 2,000 pounds will hold a ship weighing 5,000
tons, yet when brought to such a position as will permit
of its being tilted up it can be broken-out by an engine
of five horse-power.</p>

<p>Since Pering's day many improved anchors have
been patented; of these only two, the Rodgers and
Trotman, are of any account. Of what are called "patent
anchors," that is, anchors of peculiar shapes, there is this
to say, they are inferior to the original form. The only
argument in their favor is that they stow easier, and it is
for this reason that the stockless variety is employed on
steam vessels. This form can be hauled directly into the
hawse pipe, thus doing away with the labor of catting
and fishing, but they will not hold with the old form, and
need a much longer scope of hawse. I have experimented
with several of those built for yachts and have in
every case found them inferior to the common anchor.
They are useful sometimes as stern-holds, and for dropping
on ragged bottom, where a common hook is liable
to foul.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>For use where a vessel is anchored in a current, and
is apt to be tide-rode, the Trotman is excellent. The peculiarity
of this anchor is, that the arms are pivoted so
that the fluke of the upper arm when the hook is biting
is down on the shank; this prevents the hawser from
fouling and upsetting the anchor if the yacht happens to
ride over it.</p>

<p>The average yacht anchor that is found on sale is an
instrument that could be largely improved without adding
to its cost or weight. A better distribution of the
metal would add much to its value, but its worst feature
is the method in which the stock is secured in the head.
These pins are always a nuisance, frequently working out
and more frequently being lost. There are anchors made
in which the stock screws in, and others in which the stock
passes through a slot with a lug, which, on being turned,
engages with the side of the head, preventing its slipping
back. Both these are better than the pin. Every yachtsman
knows what it is to find the pin missing just when it
is wanted and wanted in a hurry, and to have to substitute
a nail or a penknife blade. There is a small fortune
for the man who will bring out an anchor with a stock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
that can be shipped and unshipped quickly, and yet stay
fast when down on the bottom.</p>

<p>The strain on anchors when holding a vessel is nothing
like what it is commonly supposed to be. If it was
how could a vessel be drawn up to her anchor? It has to
blow very hard when a man cannot draw a small yacht
up to her hook. The reason of this is, that the windage
of an anchored vessel is a comparatively small surface,
so long as she lies head-on. It is the sum of the area of
the widest section of the above-water hull, and the area of
the rigging and spars, found by multiplying their diameters
by their lengths. This is, as I have said, a comparatively
small surface.</p>

<p>In a strong blow, such as yachtsmen generally describe
as a gale, the wind pressure is only about five
pounds to the square foot, while in an ordinary breeze,
such as usually blows in summer, the pressure is scant of
a pound. So that a boat with a hundred square feet of
windage would, in a yachtsman's gale, only be forced back
by a pressure of 500 pounds. Some day, just for your
own enlightenment, take a spring scale and put it on
your hawse when the yacht is riding to a wind with no
sea on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>One day my boat was lying in a tide running at a rate
of one mile. The bottom was a medium hard gravel and
the water perfectly clear. In turning tides she had capsized
the anchor and it was lying stock up and flukes
flat. This anchor, weighing thirty pounds, by its weight
and friction of the stock end on the bottom kept the boat
stationary. Her displacement was just over four tons.
The anchor was simply resisting the friction of the tide
on the immersed hull. Reverse this and it shows how
small is the power necessary to drive a vessel one mile an
hour.</p>

<p>The direct strain on anchors is of no consequence except
in very high winds; it is the sea that causes them
to leave their hold. Go back to our pick for an explanation.
When given sufficient scope the anchor, like the
pick, is resisting a pull at right angles, and stands fast,
but the minute the sea begins to move the vessel up and
down the handle of the anchor is worked up and down;
the shorter the scope the more surely is this motion
transmitted, and the more effective is it in breaking-out
the arm. To prevent this in a heavy sea we resort to a
practice called backing.</p>

<p>The object of backing an anchor is to prevent this up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
and down motion from passing from the vessel to the
anchor. In order to do this it is necessary to weight the
cable, so as to prevent its lifting from the bottom, some
distance inside of the anchor. This is done either by
leading the cable through another anchor or by weighting
the cable with ballast. The last is the better method,
as it can be done from the vessel without disturbing the
hawse.</p>

<p>I find that few yachtsmen make a study of anchoring;
mostly because they anchor in places where there is
little to be feared either from wind or sea. It is only
when they get into harbors where both are to be dreaded
that they learn this part of the trade. To show how universally
careless we are in this respect it is only necessary
to recall the disastrous effects an unexpected summer
gale has upon a fleet of our yachts. In August, 1893,
a storm of this character swept the Eastern seaboard,
and some eighty yachts were driven ashore and many of
them totally wrecked. In the summer of 1897 a moderate
gale came on the coast, and out of a fleet of some
thirty yachts anchored and moored about the boat I was
in, twelve went adrift. The same day, in and around
Boston, the storm played havoc with the pleasure fleet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>Another time we were caught off the Thimbles in Long
Island Sound in company with a small fleet. Everything
dragged and several were only saved by a lucky shift
of wind from going on the rocks. Many of these boats
had no spare anchors; some had the anchors and not
sufficient cable; others had ground tackle much too light
for their bulk. Few of the crews knew how to properly
use what they did have. I was in a 30-foot sloop of the
old flat type, an exceedingly bad sea boat. We rode it
out with two anchors and 300 pounds of ballast down
ahead, but it was only by judicious management, and the
addition of a new mainsheet to our scanty length of
cable.</p>

<p>Every boat should carry two anchors, and every boat
that cannot readily make fast to a dock, three. The
weight of anchors to be carried can only be approximated,
as it depends largely upon the build of the vessel,
the extent and prevailing conditions of her sailing waters
and the service engaged in. A boat that is only used for
day-sailing that finds shelter at night in a safe harbor and
moors or makes fast, needs but light ground tackle. She
can get along with an anchor weighing a half-pound to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
each foot of over-all length, and need never to resort to
her spare hook except on extraordinary occasions.</p>

<p>Narrow deep boats with sharp entrances are very light
on their ground tackle and do not need nearly as heavy
anchors as do broad shoal boats. Our modern full-bowed
boats are very hard on all kinds of gear, and need
especially heavy anchors and cables. Flat-bottomed
craft, like sharpies and scow houseboats, are the hardest
of all, and your hooks and hawsers can't be too heavy to
make sure of holding them. High-sided and high-housed
yachts are also hard riders, the windage having a
tendency to keep them worrying at their hawse. All
these things must be taken into consideration when selecting
a weight of anchor and a size of cable or chain,
but, as it is always best to err on the safe side, be less
afraid of getting too heavy gear than of getting too light.
A 20-foot boat will hold to a ten-pound anchor, if the
hook is well proportioned and takes a good hold in good
ground, but I should not feel comfortable in turning in
on a rough night with only that weight of iron out ahead
of me. An old fellow, who is a bit of a crank on the
subject, once took me to task for carrying such heavy
anchors and cables. To his mind they were totally un<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>necessary; ones half the weight and size would do as
well. He used a twelve-thread line and an anchor about
vest-pocket size on his boat.</p>

<p>His argument was good from his side of the deck, but
things had a different aspect from mine. In the first
place, he always anchored where he wanted to, but I,
being a roving bird, had frequently to anchor where I
did not want to. In the second, if I turned in to sleep I
had to do so feeling sure that my boat would be in the
same place the next morning, or else I could not sleep
peacefully. Again, a small line is awkward to handle
and is easily chafed through; these are things to be considered
as well as strength. The breaking strain of a
cable used should always be at least four times the weight
you expect to put on it. It is to the extra factor of safety
that you must frequently trust for the odd trick and the
game.</p>

<p>A heavily-built cabin craft, or a yacht loaded with
lead on the keel, needs an anchor at least a pound weight
for each foot of her deck length. This is for a regular
stand-by, something to be used whenever she comes to a
halt. Such weight will, under all ordinary conditions, give
sufficient hold, admitting that the bottom is suitable for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
anchoring. I have seen a 25-foot cabin sloop hang to a
twenty-pound anchor in a gale of wind, in a place where
there was no sea to bother her. But the sea is what
troubles the anchor, not the direct strain.</p>

<p>A yacht of 40 feet, used for cruising to distant ports
and anchoring here, there, and everywhere, should carry
four anchors. Of course you can get along with less,
perhaps, for many seasons, but to have peace of mind
and absolute security, you need four. Two of these anchors
are for constant use and the other two for special
work and dangerous emergencies.</p>

<p>The two first are what are called on large vessels
bowers, being the anchors hung at the bows, but we will
sometimes speak of them as stand-bys, they being the instruments
always ready for use. The third is a light
fellow, exceedingly useful when needed, called a kedge.
The fourth is the big-weight, whose services are only
called upon as the last resource, and who passes the bulk
of his days in idleness below&mdash;he is called the spare.</p>

<p>The stand-bys for a 40-footer should weigh together
twice the boat's length in pounds&mdash;80 pounds. This can
either be evenly divided or unevenly, as you see fit. I
prefer to divide the weight unevenly, having, say, one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
thirty-five and one forty-five-pound, or one thirty and
one fifty-pound. These anchors should be galvanized
and be uniformly strong throughout, the large one
being of heavy shank and broad palm; the smaller,
lighter in build, with narrow palm and sharp bill. This
lighter anchor should always be ready for service under
the bowsprit or at the cathead.</p>

<p>On a cruiser the heavier stand-by should also be kept
ready to shackle to the chain or bend to the hawser.
It need not be kept hanging under the bowsprit or at the
cathead, but can be lashed on the fore deck, so as to be
available for instant use. I remember once going ashore
because the owner insisted upon having the second anchor
unshackled and stowed below; his reason being
that it made the boat look untidy forward. When we
rounded-to and let go the small one, the chain parted;
and before the other could be brought on deck and bent
on we were blown on the beach.</p>

<p>The spare anchor is kept below, but not, as in most
boats, in a place where you cannot get at it without
hauling over a mass of dunnage. One time, when anchored
in an open bight, we were joined at sunset by a
large sloop; she letting go outside and to windward of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
us. During the night it came on to blow very hard,
and at daylight we were riding to both anchors with a
full hawse ahead. The big sloop was dragging badly,
and, in response to their calls for help, I took my crew
and went aboard her. She was in charge of her owner
and three other amateurs. They had let go both her
bowers and all the chain, but they failed to hold the
yacht and she was slowly going for the beach.</p>

<p>As soon as I got on board I asked if they had a spare
anchor. The owner, who had just bought the boat and
was taking her home, after a little thinking, said he
thought it was mentioned in the inventory, but he had
never looked to see. Taking my two hands I went below
to the usual place and began a search. We pulled out
sails in bags and sails out of bags, awnings and stanchions,
old mops, holystones, rope, brooms, deck cushions
and the devil knows what, before finally the spare hook
was brought to light. Into a cabin, that looked like a
South street junk shop, we at last lugged it and its cable,
and from the looks of both, decided it was their first call
to action. That as may be, when once overboard they
did yeoman service and held the sloop in safety. I did
not fail to read the owner a lesson on how not to keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
his reserve ground tackle, and I guess the job of putting
the dunnage back helped to impress it on his mind.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <a name="illus140" id="illus140"><img src="images/illus-140.jpg" width="474" height="600"
     alt="Sketch of an anchor with Ring, Head, Pin, Stock, Shank, Bill, Palm, Fluke, Arm, Crown" /></a>
</div>

<p>The spare anchor occupies but little room if properly
stowed, takes up the work of the same weight of ballast,
and is a harmless but exceedingly useful creature. It
inspires a feeling of safety that more than pays for its
keep. This anchor should always be used with a hawser,
and a long and stout one, and to make assurance doubly
sure, should be fitted with three fathoms of chain and
a stout ring to which to bend the rope. You can either
have the chain permanently attached to anchor or hawser
as you prefer, but keep both where the ends can be
readily laid hands upon. The best place to stow it is aft
under the cockpit floor, placing it in such a way as it
will lie snug and not get adrift, no matter how the boat
pitches or heels. If your compass is over it, you had
better see that the placing of it does not affect that instrument,
and if so, how much. Frequently compasses
are thrown into error by the keeping of anchors and
awning stanchions under the cockpit floor.</p>

<p>The fourth anchor&mdash;the kedge&mdash;is a most useful piece
of furniture. Being light and easy to handle it can be
kept on the bows when racing or cruising. If it falls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
calm it is there to let go and hold you; if you go ashore it
can be at once run out with a line to haul off, and if you
miss a mooring it will enable you to hang on until a line
can be carried to the buoy. It is useful when coming-to at
a dock or when finding a berth in a basin or slip; light
enough to be thrown over anywhere you can anchor by
the stern or head with equal facility. Having it allows
you in racing on tender trimming craft to keep the stand-by
anchor below out of the way and where it will interfere
least with the trim of the boat. Heavy weights hung
on a boat's nose do not improve either its speed or its
bad weather qualities. To a cruising man a kedge is invaluable;
I would as soon be without my compass as my
little hook. In boats under 35 feet the kedge takes the
place of the smaller bower and performs its duties.</p>

<p>To give good service a kedge must be a properly designed
kedge, not simply a small anchor. The proper
kedge is what is known as spider-built&mdash;long arms, long
shank, long stock and narrow, sharp flukes. It is difficult
to get these ready-made, but the shipsmith will make
you one. The best substitute for a genuine kedge is the
seine anchor.</p>

<p>Now what is the best to use with these anchors&mdash;chain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
or rope? With an anchor like the stand-by, chain is best
for all boats that have a place to stow it. Chain is more
lasting, less dirty, and takes but little room in comparison
with the same length of rope. Hawsers are always in
the way, no matter how neatly they are coiled down. Besides
they are expensive, owing to their short lives. In
bad weather you cannot well keep them on deck, and
they are wet and disagreeable cabinmates.</p>

<p>For the kedge a long light line should be used, something
that one man can readily handle. It is best to have
it in two parts; one part being kept stowed away and the
other always bent. Then you have less of a coil on deck
or in the bow locker, but have, by bending on the second
piece, a length that will enable you to kedge off or on to
advantage.</p>

<p>For the spare I prefer, and so will any man who has
experience, a hawser. In heavy weather a boat will ride
much easier to hemp than she will to chain; no matter
how much of the latter you may pay out, she has the
weight to lift every time she takes up the slack, and consequently
rises slower and falls quicker. Hemp, until it
gets well soaked, puts little of its weight on a riding vessel,
and besides the give of the slack it stretches in itself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>But whichever you use, be sure and have plenty of it.
Remember this: that the first and all-important thing
in anchoring is SCOPE.</p>

<p>One night, not long ago, we wanted to anchor a yawl,
as it was calm and the tide setting us away from our port.
My companions let the anchor go without first sounding;
it ran to the bitter end of the chain with no bottom.
As the chart only gave 15 fathoms I was rather surprised
and supposed I had miscalculated the yacht's position,
but, as my bearings seemed to be correct, I overhauled
the chain. How much chain do you think was on that
anchor? The boat being an old-fashioned plumb-stemmer,
32 feet on top. Just 10 fathoms. Gaze on that&mdash;10
fathoms of chain to anchor a boat of that size. Why, to
make it hold in a breeze of wind you would have to be in
eight feet of water.</p>

<p>The former owner, who was responsible for this, was
a man who never went ten miles from his home port, and
I should judge knew very little about vessel handling.
There are hundreds of other boats in just the same fix.
And still we wonder why yachts blow ashore.</p>

<p>Now, as we are through with the anchors, let us bear-off
for a bit and tackle the subject of anchoring, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
is the art of using them. Let me here remark that in all
my experience I never had anchors fail to do their duty,
when properly used and attended to, and that every scrape
in this line that ever I got my boat into, was due to my
own carelessness or laziness or somebody else's. I have
had hawsers part and chains break, and I have broken
arms of anchors and have lost them altogether, but in
every case the accident was avoidable if proper forethought
and precaution had been used.</p>

<p>If you are rather new at the business, or have hands
forward that you cannot rely upon, when making port
have the hook cleared away early in the game. Then
go forward and see that all is in order. When she comes
to let it be at sufficient distance to leeward to kill all
way before she reaches the selected berth. When stopped
dead give your order to let go. Then comes in the judgment
as to how much scope she needs. Whatever the decision,
always lean to the side of more than less.</p>

<p>Before anchoring in a strange place consult the chart,
and know the bottom, depth, and fall of the tide, also its
present height; this is of especial importance in places
where there is a big rise. In light weather, for a short<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
stay, six times the depth is sufficient; that is, in six feet
of water give her six fathoms of cable.</p>

<p>If it is blowing hard and a sea running, before letting
go, if you are using a hawser, range a good length of it
on deck clear for running out. Get a good turn round
the bitts and after the hook has taken hold slack away
handsomely, but at the same time keep full control. Let
her take it out; don't give it to her. When the hawser
has a lead that enters the water well ahead, make fast, and
watch how she rides to it.</p>

<p>You can tell by feeling the cable whether the anchor
is biting or not. If it continues to drag and drags rapidly
it is probably foul; if it drags slowly it is most likely bad
bottom; your chart will tell you what kind.</p>

<p>Never drop without first taking a range, either on
shore or on a nearby vessel, for not only will it tell you
if you are dragging, but it is the only sure way of locating
an anchor if you lose it. The way to tell if you are
dragging at night or when you cannot get a range is to
drop the lead overside with a slack line; if she drags the
line will trend out ahead.</p>

<p>If your hook drags badly and you have sail on, get it
up, and do the act over again. If you cannot, why then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
heave in rapidly on the first and when under foot let go
your second. Do not, if you possibly can help it, let go
the second while the foul anchor is out ahead, for if it
should stick it will put you in the predicament of having
an unreliable hold at the end of your longest cable.</p>

<p>If the first anchor drags because the bottom is bad
holding, then shorten up, let go your second, and pay
out on both. If she still continues to drag get up the
spare, and if you can, heave in on both to half-hawse,
and then let the spare go. If she goes on dragging you
have two hopes and one alternative. One hope is, that
the weather will let up; the other, that as she drags
she will get into better holding ground; the alternative
I will attend to in another chapter.</p>

<p>Many accidents are the result of haste and carelessness,
when letting the hook go. A mate of mine once let the
anchor drop without fitting the pin in the stock; it came
on to blow in the night and we dragged down on another
yacht. Dropping the hook while a vessel has headway on
is another cause of anchors being foul. Frequently in
small yachts carrying the hook under the bowsprit, the
fluke will catch on the bobstay; instead of hauling it up
and clearing it, a lubber will let the stock drop down and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
then lift the fluke up and let all go. What is the consequence?
the arm falls across the cable and you have a
foul anchor. Twice in my life I have had men anchor the
boat on the bobstay. This happened at night and through
my not going forward and looking to things myself. Instead
of, like the unfortunate Wentworth, exclaiming:
"Put not your trust in princes," let me cry, "Put not your
trust in amateurs," especially coming to anchor at night.
But the most frequent cause of mishap is in giving either
too little or too much scope. Laziness stands impeached
of the first, and over-caution of the second.</p>

<p>Before turning in, if the weather looks at all dubious,
but not threatening enough to warrant your going to
the trouble of sending off another anchor, you can secure
yourself from a sudden attack by these means. We will
suppose you are riding to your heaviest bower. Down the
second bower under the fore-foot, being careful to see
that it falls clear, then take the end of your hawser from
underneath the coil, and take a round-turn round the
mast, securing the end with two half hitches over the
standing part. See that it renders freely from the top of
the coil. Pass it through either the chock on the bowsprit
or the chock on the rail. If the yacht drags she will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
carry out the hawser and fetch-up when the end is
reached. If you are using chain see that it is clear for
running out. By employing your second anchor in this
way, you will prevent fouling hawse if the yacht swings
with the tide or wind.</p>

    <p>How to Anchor with Two Hooks Down</p>
    <p style="font-variant: normal">A is the right way; B the wrong way.</p>
    <p style="font-variant: normal">C shows anchor backed with ballast.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Backing an anchor is done in several ways, but as it
is only done in extreme cases you are generally obliged
to do it the best way you can, using such materials as are
at hand. Take two or four pigs of ballast, wrap them securely
with a strong small line, and put on a shawl-strap
handle over the chain and let them slide down with a
small line attached to prevent their working right out to
the anchor. A small piece of chain is better than rope
to use on a chain hawse. If you can heave in you can
lash the ballast to the chain, and then pay out again.</p>

<p>Backing is usually done at the last call, and as it is wet
and dangerous work on a small boat's head when she is
pitching with a sea, the job is a hurry one and is frequently
bungled. By putting a line on the ballast you can recover
it if the lashing parts or frets through.</p>

<p>A trip-line is made fast to an anchor with a clove hitch
round the crown, and either buoyed or led on board.
If led on board, it should be stopped down to the heel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
of the shank with a rotten stop and belayed with plenty
of slack.</p>

<p>Now I am going to give you ten rules for anchoring,
but be pleased to remember that these rules are not fixed
laws, and as such do not bind you to do anything against
what judgment, experience, or a present difficulty may
suggest.</p>

<p>1. Never drop an anchor until you have first examined it.</p>
<p>2. Never drop an anchor stock down.</p>
<p>3. Never drop an anchor from the bows while the boat
has headway, except for the purpose of preventing her
going ashore or into something.</p>
<p>4. With the wind and sea ahead give any amount of
scope.</p>
<p>5. In a tide-way give just sufficient to hold, no more,
unless the conditions of wind and sea oblige a long lead;
then watch your hawse when she shifts tides.</p>
<p>6. When getting underway in a strong wind, do not
shorten too much before everything is ready aloft; same
when surrounded by other vessels.</p>
<p>7. Be sure when you make fast, that you make fast.
Always weather-bit your hawser before turning in. Don't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
make fast over an old set of turns when you shorten
hawse. Always keep your riding-bits clear of everything
but the hawser.</p>
<p>8. Always examine the gear before leaving the yacht
or turning in. If she is riding hard, feel if she is fast or
dragging.</p>
<p>9. Keep your hawsers or chains leading free of the bowsprit
rigging. Look out for chafing and freshen the
hawse frequently.</p>
<p>10. Never anchor on rocky bottom without a trip line.</p>

<p>These weights should be (excepting kedge) increased 25 per cent.
when anchors are for use on a broad shoal model, and can be decreased if
model is very sharp and the hull light. There is no advantage to be had
by decreasing the weight of the spare in any case. Anchors are seldom
forged to weigh exactly the above weights, but the matter of a few pounds
either way will not effect the service.</p>

"Then let his vessel feel the strain<br />

And proudly dares the stormy blast."
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p class="subheader">ON RIGGING</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">When</span> we speak of a vessel's rigging we mean
everything that supports the spars and is employed
in setting and trimming the sails. Rigging
is divided into two classes&mdash;standing and running.
The first is the portion that remains stationary, and whose
office is to hold and strengthen the spars. The second is
rove through blocks and moves; its office is to hoist,
lower and trim the sails.</p>

<p>Rigging has been much simplified of late years owing
to the use of better proportioned fittings and stronger
materials. The use of wire rope in place of hemp has
reduced the size and weight of standing rigging, and
what is of more importance, given a stable factor.</p>

<p>In the old days when hemp was used, the shrouds
and stays had to be constantly watched, as they varied in
length every time there was a large change in the atmosphere.
This was a frequent cause of dismasting. A ves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>sel before leaving port would have her rigging set up in
dry, cold weather; going to sea she would run into a
warm region and everything would slack up. As it is
now, the expansion and contraction of wire rigging is
so small that a few turns of a screw will take it up or give
it back. The only danger from wire is in setting it up
too taut when at its full stretch, but this, in such length
as go to make the shrouds of a yacht, is little to be feared.
But the funnel guys of steam-yachts should be frequently
looked to, as the expansion of the iron is liable to pull
out the deck eye-bolts.</p>

<p>I am not going to tell you how to rig a yacht, because
you can learn that better and quicker by doing as the
Yankee did who wanted to learn how to make clocks&mdash;took
one apart and put it together again. Just strip a
yacht, then re-rig her, and you will be in a fair way to
learn all about it. What I am going to do, is to point
out to you a few things in regard to rigging that may aid
you in taking better care of what you have, and in making
more secure and simple its use.</p>

<p>The one axiom of the business is this, and I want you
to engrave it on your memory, for the violation of its
truth is the cause of nine out of ten breakdowns: The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
weakest part of any shroud, stay or tackle is its strongest
part. If you take two pieces of chain capable of lifting
a ton, and join them with a piece of rope capable of lifting
five hundred pounds, your combination is only as
strong as the rope, and will only lift the smaller weight.
This is why shrouds so frequently give way; the wire rope
is strong enough, the splice is firm, but the rigging-screw
is only capable of bearing half the strain of those
parts. Same with halliards; the tackle will lift a ton,
the pin in the block or shackle not five hundred pounds.
All parts of any tackle must be proportionately strong.</p>

<p>The most unreliable portion of a yacht's rigging is the
ironwork. In the first place, much of it is badly proportioned,
and in the second place it is too light. There is
no sense in making ironwork so light as is frequently
done. The amount of weight saved, especially in those
parts attached to the hull, is of no importance. Another
source of weakness, especially in chain plates, is in making
the straps too short; not giving room for the fastenings.
Chain plates should be carried right down and be
secured to the frame.</p>

<p>The kingpin of the whole structure erected above the
deck of a yacht is the bobstay. If that goes you are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
liable to lose everything, and it does go frequently. The
principal cause of its parting is the over setting up of the
headstays. Sometimes the bobstay itself is set up too
taut, at other times the jib stay is strained. One way or
another the spring of a spar is brought on it, and the
vessel, getting into a head sea, begins to pitch; this causes
a back-lashing and away goes a bolt or a plate.</p>

<p>Not long ago we were trying to insure a yacht that was
to go South. The underwriters refused the risk on the
ground that the yacht would get dismasted, and be
obliged to put back or be lost altogether. At the same
time they willingly took a risk on two small topsail
schooners bound to the West Indies. We all sailed within
four days. The yacht went through all right, but both
the schooners lost their fore topmasts, bowsprits, jib booms
and other headgear, and had to return to New York for
a refit. They ran into a high head sea, and the foremast,
being set up on the bowsprit, the bobstay parted under
the strain and away everything went.</p>

<p>I have seen a small racing boat with a bronze rod of &#8540;
inch diameter for a bobstay, and this secured to the stem
with two one-inch screws. You cannot make your bobstay
too strong or fasten it too securely. It was formerly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
a custom to fit two bobstays, a regular one and a smaller
one, called a preventer. This latter was set up slack of
the heavier one. For many reasons this was a poor practice,
it being far better to put the strength of the two in
one. In another chapter I have told you how to rig a
tackle preventer for use when going to sea.</p>

<p>Bowsprit shrouds should be made heavy, and carried
as far aft as possible to get a spread. Care should
be taken to set them up evenly. Foot ropes under a bowsprit
are unsightly, and are not needed unless the spar is
long. If your jib stay is carried through the spar and
made fast to the stem, it should render freely in the
bee hole. Unless it does it is liable to strain the spar.
I nearly lost a mast once by the jib stay sawing into the
wood and sticking. It parted in a sea-way, and the shock
broke the bobstay shackle. Every cruising boat should
have two shrouds to a side. On pole-mast boats one of
these should run to the hounds and the other to the
masthead. Don't set them up to bands; eye-splice and
put them over the spar. You never can trust the eye in
a band. The rigging screws should be just twice as
heavy as what the average man will tell you to use. The
screw is the weak part. Cutting the thread destroys the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
strength of the metal. The extra weight is nothing to
speak of; the extra strength is everything. Although
they are more trouble to care for I prefer lanyards.</p>

<p>Always keep your shrouds set up bar-taut; the old
notion that a mast should have play is a fallacy. The
stiffer your spar the better it will carry sail. In our
modern boats a mast should be kept plumb. From what
I have seen all boats sail better with their masts plumb.
Another thing, don't cut your sheer-poles too short; they
are so cut on half the boats I have seen; the consequence
is they are always working loose.</p>

<p>On many yachts the rope used in the running rigging
is too small. It may be plenty strong enough, but a man
gets tired of picking up and pulling on shoestrings. This
is a frequent fault with main-sheets; another is not having
enough parts. A sheet tackle should be powerful
enough to give one man control of the sail at any time.
Weak travelers is another defect. This should be doubly
strong, as it is frequently used to tow or make fast to.
Every boat should have a strong ringbolt on each side
in the quarters for boom lashings, etc.</p>

<p>There are plenty of good blocks and plenty of bad
ones. The modern metal blocks are good, but should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
be of a big passage, as the gear when wet is apt to jam
in them. This is a fault with all blocks having small
sheaves. The weak part of a block is either the pin or
the shackle.</p>

<p>On small boats a single topping lift is all that is
needed, but on yawls and ketches, where the main boom
is inboard and short, two lifts are better. Boats with
heavy spars should have a jig fitted to the lift. Lazy
jacks are useful on cruising boats, especially if you are
sailing short handed, but they are a nuisance when reefing.
The ends should be made fast in such a way as to
allow of their being slacked up, but not so as to permit
of their getting adrift. I have got into trouble several
times through the lazy jacks getting adrift. The ends
blew across the peak halliards, and fouled them in such
way as to prevent the sail from coming down. If this
happens at night when reefing you are liable to be in a
fix. I may as well say here that the ends of all running
gear should be made fast.</p>

<p>If you have a pin-rail this is easily done. Take out
the pin and slip the socket through the rope between the
strands, shove it on the collar of the projection and put
the pin back. If your halliards are belayed to cleats, marl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
them to the cleat. At night or in a blow the crew will let
go one halliard to pick up another, and away goes the
end flying out. If it is dark it can't be found, as more
than likely it is wrapped round a shroud or lift, or is
flying out from aloft like a pennant. I have had some
anxious times hunting the ends of gear of a dark, windy
night. When sailing in the dark or in bad weather make
the end of your mainsheet fast; always keep a knot in it.
Jib's sheet should be endless, running right round the
cockpit. Then you can always find them, and the end
won't wash overboard.</p>

<p>It is the custom now to put bridles or spans on gaffs
and booms in order to distribute the strain. They are
good things if used in moderation, but it is extremely
foolish to put a rig of this kind on a twenty-footer carried
out in the lavish fashion of a cup defender. I have seen
little boats knocking about with spans on the boom that
would pretty nearly have held the Columbia's spar. Some
of our designers have an especial fad for loading down
boats with all kinds of gear, and seem to glory in bridling
everything that offers the least excuse for such fittings.
The first thing that a good racing man has to do when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
he gets one of these boats is to strip off about half the
stuff and change leads all round.</p>

<p>Complicated running rigging is a nuisance; it cannot
be too simple so long as it is effective. The less strings
you have to pull the quicker you can work. This is just
as true on a cruiser as it is on a racer. A lot of line is
also a nuisance round the decks; a clear deck is a sailor's
blessing.</p>

<p>One of the things I have helped to simplify is the gear
on spinnakers. Long ago I pointed out that this sail
could be used on small boats without outhauls and lifts,
and that without them the sail was easier set and easier
taken in. This method of handling that sail has since
been practiced on the majority of our racing craft. Half
the spinnaker poles are too heavy for their length, and
the sails too big to be effective in anything but extremely
light weather. All gear belonging to the pole should be
snap-hooked, so that it can be attached or detached at
once.</p>

<p>Snap-hooks and sister-hooks are excellent contrivances,
but beware of them. They have a trick of giving
out just at the wrong time, and are to blame for many a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
lost spar. They should be extra large and strong if they
are to be subjected to heavy and continued strains.</p>

<p>All gear, especially the iron work, should be constantly
examined, not only when at anchor, but while
under way. Many men never look at their boat's gear
from the time she is put overboard until she is hauled
out. Here is a case that fell under my notice: A boat
was being stripped for hauling out, when we noticed that
her mast was shaky; on examining the step it was found
that the heel of the spar was just in it and no more, allowing
the mast to play. Taking her under the shears,
we raised the spar, and found lying in the step a cold
chisel that prevented the heel from dropping home. This
boat had been sailed about all summer, and the owner
admitted that he noticed something was wrong with the
mast, but that he had never examined the step. Another
time I was on a cutter that carried away her mast-head.
When we examined the break it was found that the stick
was completely rotted through. The damage was caused
by hollowing of the wood above the upper band, which
allowed the rain water to stand and soak into the grain.</p>

<p>If I have a boat in charge I make it a duty to go aloft
at least once a week when she is under way and take a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
careful survey of all the ironwork, blocks and splices. I
also examine the bowsprit rigging thoroughly. The
ironwork should be sounded with a hammer or heavy
knife blade, just as railroad men sound carwheels. Blocks
should be looked to and kept well oiled. Turnbuckles
should also be kept oiled, and if you are out in much
rough water they should be covered with a false parceling
of painted canvas. If this is done they won't freeze,
and when you want to tauten or slack the rigging you
will be able to do so without using a lot of kerosene and
hard twisting.</p>

<p>On cruising boats with outboard booms reef-pendants
for the two lower reefs are generally kept rove, but they
are much of a nuisance. This can be obviated in a
measure by having them in two lengths, keeping one part
in the sail and the other in the locker when not in use.
If the sail is heavy a small tackle is handy. Such a
tackle should be carried on all boats; it saves a lot of
hard labor, especially if you take ground and have to
haul off.</p>

<p class="subheader">ON STRANDING</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">This</span> is a subject upon which I can pose as a master.
If any man has been ashore more times than I
have, I should like to meet him and spend an
evening comparing notes. One of my favorite amusements
is to sail into places where a man of sense has no
business to go; consequently my boat is continually being
hung up on rocks, shoals and bars. While this is
not particularly good for the boat, it has done me no
harm, as I have gathered a lot of knowledge and experience
which, you willing, I will spread before you.</p>

<p>Yachts, unlike merchant vessels, are seldom damaged
by taking ground. This is because, in proportion to
their weight, they are extremely strong fabrics. A merchant
vessel when loaded has little reserve buoyancy,
and when she strikes, she hits hard; but a yacht is almost
as buoyant as an empty barrel, and unless she hits with a
perpendicular portion, does so very lightly.</p>

<p>Frequently when a yacht hits a rock it seems to those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
on board as if the end of things had come; but when an
examination is made it will be found that little harm has
been done.</p>

<p>I once struck a rock with a small sloop. It was blowing
a strong breeze and considerable sea running. When
she struck, the blow was terrific; it threw me over the
wheel to land on my head in the fore end of the cockpit,
and knocked the rest off their pins. The centerboard
was driven clear up out of the case against the cabin roof,
the sloop making a jump over the stone and into deep
water on the other side.</p>

<p>We all thought the boat must be badly damaged, but
as she made no water, we turned round and worked her
home. When she was hauled out, the only sign of the
blow was a dent in the lead keel just deep and wide
enough to hold a finger.</p>

<p>Another time I was in a bulb-fin boat, racing, when
she struck a rock. She was close-hauled and going like
a scared cat. It felt like banging up against a stone wall,
the shock sending us all flying forward. The damage
done amounted to a bruised bulb and a slightly bent fin;
the hull was, so far as we could ascertain by superficial
inspection, unhurt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>Metal-shod keels are undoubtedly a great protection,
and a yacht that strikes fairly on her iron or lead will
seldom be damaged to such an extent as to endanger her
safety. I have known boats to be sunk by striking rocks,
but they hit either the side of the bow or the bilge and
stove in the plank. For this reason, if you find yourself
going on a rock, always take it stem-to. By this means
I jumped a rock in Wood's Hole that was six inches out
of water, and landed all right on the other side.</p>

<p>The most dangerous thing to do, yet the thing that is
most natural to do, is to put the helm up or down with
the hopes of escaping; consequently your craft is carried
on, and strikes broadside. This not only is liable to bilge
her, but makes it far more difficult to get her off. It is
especially dangerous if you go on with a weather wind
or tide.</p>

<p>Always remember that wounds in a hull are least
dangerous at the ends, and most dangerous in the middle
body. If a boat is pierced in her head or tail you
may be able to trim the leak out, or save her from sinking
by stranding and jacking the leaky end up, but if she
is pierced amidships you cannot get at the hole unless
you haul completely out. I remember seeing a sand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>bagger that had torn the plank away from her stem
saved from sinking by trimming, the crew raising her
head by piling all the bags aft.</p>

<p>Luckily for the navigator, the sea by constant washing,
and nature by a covering of seaweed and slime, prepares
the majority of rocks for his reception, so that if he
strikes the object fairly with sufficient way on, his craft
will slide over. But sometimes he runs against a ragged
reef, and then there is trouble. The reefs and lone rocks
along our coast are generally worn smooth, and are not
dangerous customers like the coral formations of warmer
climes. One of the worst things to run on is a reef of
small boulders, as you are liable to get one on either side
just under the bilge. These places are the remains of a
point or island, and are good places to fight shy of. The
worst boats to take ground are flat-bottomed craft like
sharpies; when they go on they generally make a perfect
job of it. They are bad things to strand on a sand-bar
or flat, the bottom of the boat sucking like a leech to a
turtle's hindquarter. Unless you can get the tide to lift
one of this kind off, it is either jettison the ballast or dig
out. A man who knocks about a sandy land in a sharpie
should always carry a shovel with him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>The first rule of action upon stranding is to at once
lower all sail. There is but one exception to this; I will
state it later. You cannot drive a vessel off ground with
her sails (you may back her off); at least I never could.
The reason of this is that a boat under sail pressure
drives down, and draws more water the harder you force
her. Again, if you drive her off, or over bottom, with
the sails, you are likely to damage the hull or break the
rudder.</p>

<p>After taking off sail run out a kedge against the wind
or current, unless both are ahead; then take it out the
way you came in. Give it all the line you can; the
straighter the pull the less likely that your anchor will
come home. As soon as it is down, heave taut, and keep
the vessel's stern to the sea, current or wind, whichever
is most powerful. This done, if on a rock, go below and
see if she is making water. While you are doing this
let the other hands sound round the craft to find how she
lies.</p>

<p>If she is not leaking, get all your beef on the hawser
and heave away. Here is where a handy-billy or watch-tackle
comes in. Sometimes you can use the windlass,
but this is not as good as a tackle, because the hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
have to stand forward to work it, and you want all the
weight aft. If she refuses to budge under the pull, go
below, and if you have inside weight shift it aft. If she
still refuses to start, get out everything weighty, and
either lighter it or heave it over-side.</p>

<p>Sometimes you can start a boat off a rock by broadening
off the main-boom, and sending a man out on it to
roll her. Before you do this be sure and set up the topping
lift, and weather preventer if one is fitted. The
principal thing is to keep a constant and firm strain on
the hawser.</p>

<p>If there is any roll on, get the hawser set up fiddle-string
taut with the tackle, then place all hands so as to
surge it sideways every time she lifts on the sea. If the
boat is one with a deep false keel you can gain a few
inches off the draught by careening her. This is done
by taking an anchor off at right angles to her lay and
setting up the hawser by any of the mast-head tackles,
either jib or peak halyards. Never do this if there is any
sea on, as it is liable to strain the hull or break the false
keel. I don't believe it is much good, and do not recommend
its practice except as a last call.</p>

<p>Another plan which I found to work well when a boat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
is stranded on a shelving bank of either mud or sand is
to overhaul the throat halyards, and bend the gaff-block
to a bight in the hawser, letting a tail of the hawser drop
down from the block. Then set up hard on the halyard,
using the windlass or watch-tackle. This done, let a
man hang on the tail of the hawser, throwing his weight
up and down so as to surge it, the rest taking in the slack.
This makes the mast a lever to lift her, and if there is
water under the stern she will surely start.</p>

<p>In a boat with a deep sternpost and sloping keel you
can sometimes do better by swinging it on its heel, and
heaving off bow first, getting all your spare live weight
out on the bowsprit to bring her by the head; but it depends
on where she is hardest fast, and how much weight
you have to trim with. If she is fast aft of midships this
plan will work, but if forward of that point it will not.</p>

<p>The most frequent strandings are when trying to enter
the mouths of creeks or rivers; places beset with bars and
flats. If the wind and tide are ahead you can easily get
off, but if either is astern you are liable to be in a fix.
If you strike carrying the tide and wind with you, down
all sail instantly, lash the helm amidships, and get out
the anchor and long warp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>The minute a vessel strikes under these conditions she
will swing broadside-to, and drive up higher, at the same
time the tide will pile the sand or silt round her. If you
can hold her stern to the tide, the current will cut the
sand away, and the swell will help you to pull her off.</p>

<p>Now comes the only exception to the rule of taking in
sail: If you are going into an inlet with a fair wind and
head-tide, and take ground on a soft bar, keep your sails
full and hold the boat's nose to the current. If you can
keep her steady, which you can best do by getting all your
spare life weight forward, the current will cut a passage
for you. The most dangerous stranding is with a strong
in-running tide and a stern swell. A boat under these
conditions is liable to be hove over on her side and
flooded. A small steamship was lost last winter in the
Bristol Channel by an accident of this kind; she struck
on a shoal, swung beam to the tide, and rolled completely
over.</p>

<p>Several power boats have been wrecked in the same
manner, as from the narrowness of their beam they are
very liable to roll over when caught broadside-to by a
current. Another thing that often damages launches is
leaving them where, when the tide falls, they are broad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>side on a shelving bank. The water leaves them and they
fall over; the tide returns, and not having sufficient buoyancy
to lift before it rises to their coamings they are
flooded and sunk.</p>

<p>Years ago, when I was a lad, a very fast and narrow
steam launch was left by her crew on a shelving bank
close to where we were anchored. When the tide dropped
she fell over, and as her crew did not return we tried to
save her, but the bottom was too soft to allow working
on, and she filled at the flood. On the next ebb we
bailed her out, and with a little engineering and a lot of
labor got her righted up.</p>

<p>We took two big joists and lashed them across the
boat, but so poorly fitted was she with cleats and other
things to make fast to that we had to bore holes in the
deck to pass the lashing and secure them to the frame.
The ends of the joists stuck out about fifteen feet on the
high side. Under these ends we laid another timber,
parallel to the boat's length, in the mud and ballasted it
with stones and iron. To this timber we lashed two
tackles, one from each joist. Then as the tide made we
hove slowly down on them, and she righted up.</p>

<p>If the bottom had been hard we could have parbuckled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
her, but it was impossible to do it in the deep, soft mud.
This boat had a high and heavy boiler, which made the
work harder, as it levered her down.</p>

<p>If you can float another boat alongside of a launch in
this fix you can lift her by parbuckling, or you can do it
from a dock if the wall is high and near enough. To do
this, take a stout line, made fast, from the near side over
the deck and right under the keel; then lay your floating
boat alongside as close as possible, and bend this line to
the latter's throat halyards. Heave taut on it and belay.</p>

<p>If possible get two lines, one forward and one aft, having
separate tackles. As the tide makes keep heaving in
the slack, letting your floating boat draw in sideways to
the launch. This strain will aid the water in lifting, as
the launch will have to rise with the floating boat. If the
launch is very heavy or of scant beam, like the steam
craft I mentioned, you had better use joists or spars to
help the leverage.</p>

<p>I once took a launch off a rock by this same plan,
when hours of heaving on hawsers had failed to move
her. Another plan is to lift a boat by lashing empty
barrels to the side by passing slings under the keel. If
the boat is neaped so that sufficient tide cannot be got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
to lift her, you can fill and sink the barrels, bunghole up;
then shorten up the slings and pump the barrels out with
a hand-pump. This barrel trick is only performed when
a boat is bilged and full of water.</p>

<p>Let me say here that all small power boats that
cruise in strange waters where the bottom is hard should
carry either a screw or hydraulic jack, and a good stout
piece of square timber. If you get aground in places
where there is little or no rise of the tide you have something
to start in the wrecking business with. A jack and
timber are also useful if anything happens to the wheel
and you want to get the stern raised.</p>

<p>To show the danger of forcing a boat off a rock let me
cite one instance: A 50-foot sloop of the old flat-floored
centerboard model struck on a stone when going free
with a moderate wind. The sailing master kept his sails
up, and with this pressure and a warp dragged her over
and off the rock bow first. She had no sooner gone
clear than she filled and sank.</p>

<p>When floated and docked it was found that she had a
hole in her bilge big enough for a dog to crawl through.
The first blow had started a butt; this caught, and in
dragging over the plank was bent back and ripped away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
from the frames. Had he taken in sail, and pulled her off
stern first, she would have floated long enough to have
got into harbor.</p>

<p>Having considered accidental stranding, let us now
consider voluntary stranding&mdash;that is, the running of
a vessel ashore to save the vessel or the life of her crew.
Let us suppose that you are caught on a lee shore, and
for some reason cannot claw off. You are bound to go
ashore anyhow, and in order to give the boat and people
a chance decide to run in and strand her.</p>

<p>If the shore under your lee is rock I can do nothing
for you. Your only chance is to pick out an opening
or cleft and drive her in, and the minute she strikes jump
for hard land. Such places are usually to be found on
the rocky shores of our coast, but if the land is steep-to
and sheer-faced, there is little hope for the boat or her
people.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of sandy shores on which you
may have to strand your vessel&mdash;the gradual slope and
the steep slope. The former is by far the more dangerous,
as the broken water extends some distance from the
beach.</p>

<p>In running in breaking water&mdash;in fact, in running in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
all heavy seas&mdash;the rule for safety is this: Let the wave-crest
pass you, not carry you. If you can hold the boat
back, so that the wave-crest will split at her stern and
rush by on each side, the boat will travel in safety. This
is why it is dangerous in heavy water to carry sail when
running. Many men do it for fear of pooping, but there
is far less danger of pooping than there is tripping or
being brought by-the-lee. Fore-and-aft canvas, particularly
sails laced to booms, are bad things to run under;
anything in the shape of a square sail is much better.
Hundreds of vessels have been lost by running under a
press of sail&mdash;probably ten times as many as have been
destroyed by pooping.</p>

<p>Now if you are obliged to strand on a flat beach, keep
your vessel's stern to the swell and moving as slowly
as possible. The best thing to do is to tow a hawser astern,
or a small sail. This will check her way, and also prevent
the sea swinging her stern round. Watch her closely
as the sea strikes under the stern, and check the desire to
broach with the helm. She can also be aided by having
hands on a small jib or staysail sheet, and backing this
sail either on one side or the other, as the threatened
sheer requires. Get your weights out of the bow and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
keep her trimmed a bit by the stern. The idea is to
have her strike bottom on her whole keel-length, and not
on the forefoot.</p>

<p>Here is where the luck comes in. If she strikes with
her heel first and her head raised on a sea, you will
probably land well up on the beach, but if she strikes
with her forefoot first and her stern up in the air you
will land&mdash;well, only good fortune can save you.</p>

<p>I have seen fishing boats beached in this way in heavy
surf, the crews dropping an anchor and checking the
craft until the right moment, and then slacking away
smartly. In this way they rode the boat in on the back
of successive seas. With sharp-stern craft this can be
done with safety, but I would not care to try it with a
square stern or long after-overhang craft.</p>

<p>I would advise the young seaman to take a small skiff
or dingey to a beach where there is a small sea breaking
and practice making-off and landing through the surf.
He had better dress in a bathing suit, and try the game
when the water is warm. In a day or two of this work
you will learn more than I could teach you in seventy
volumes.</p>

<p>If the beach is steep-to, the sea breaking but a few rods<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
from the strand, you can stand in under good way, keeping
her end-on until close to. The instant you feel that
she is going to strike put your helm over and bring her
almost broadside to the sea. The wave rising under her
weather bilge will throw her sideways on the beach, and
each succeeding sea will drive her higher up.</p>

<p>In running at any time in heavy water use oil, letting
it drip from either bow. With a good thick slick in your
wake you will be less likely to be washed by the crests.</p>

<p>But better than all these directions is the advice to
keep off rocks, shoals and shores. Don't go into places
unknown to you unless you have a good chart or your
lead going; especially keep away from dangerous places
when the wind is brisk, the sea heavy or the tide strong.
An ounce of precaution in this matter is worth tons of
cure.</p>

<p>Nine out of ten strandings or strikings are the result
of carelessness or recklessness. The only thing a man is
justified in hitting is a wreck or a lone rock; these things
the lead will not announce, and they are frequently uncharted.
Old familiar "didn't know it was there," should
more properly be "didn't know I was there." Rocks
don't move, but you would think they did to hear many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
yachters explaining how it happened. I have hit a good
many rocks in my day, but don't believe I could prove
an alibi except in one case, when the boat ran on a stone
that nobody had ever heard of before. We examined the
stranger and found it was a rock sure enough, but where
it came from or how it got there no man knew, but all
hands stood ready to swear that they had sailed over the
exact spot many times and never touched anything.</p>

<p>I don't doubt but what there are thousands of uncharted
rocks over which and alongside of which vessels
constantly pass but do not happen to strike. Like the
celebrated Daedalus Rock, they may lurk for years in
the course of commerce, until the unfortunate boat comes
sailing along that is destined to win immortality by striking
and unmasking the danger. But it is not worth while
to worry over these vigias while there are plenty of well-known
dangers to keep the navigator busy. So proceed
fearlessly but cautiously, trusting in your lead and chart,
and hug and play with weather shores as much as you
please, but give the lee ones a wide berth.</p>

<p>Before entering an inlet, creek or river mouth, if you
are not familiar with it, lay-off or anchor outside. Send
in the dingey with a lead or pole, and sound for the deep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>est place on the bar; when this is found, let the dingey lie
there or on a line inside of it to guide you in. You may
lose a few minutes by so doing, but by the delay may save
yourself hours of hard labor and anxiety.</p>

<p>Never try to run inlets when a heavy swell is on; the
open sea is far more merciful than a bar at such times.
It is especially dangerous to attempt such places in small
power boats.</p>

<p class="ad-header">How to Build a Motor Launch</p>

<p class="center">By C. D. Mower<br />
Designing Editor of <span class="smcap">The Rudder</span></p>

<p style="margin-top: 0.5em;">A simple and practical work in every detail,
showing how to construct a launch hull
suitable for use with any description of motor.</p>

<p style="font-size: smaller">Each step of the work is clearly and thoroughly explained,
both by text and drawings, so that a man who has
never even seen a boat built will have no difficulty in
understanding the process.</p>

<p style="font-size: smaller">The author, a self-taught boat builder, thoroughly
comprehends what a novice does not know, and is, therefore,
able to point out the hard places, and to show the
amateur builder how to get over or around them.</p>

<p style="font-size: smaller">In the after part of the book are given the designs of
several launches, from 18 to 50 feet in length.</p>

<p style="font-size: smaller">The whole is heavily illustrated, and is the most
complete treatise on launch building yet published.</p>

<p class="center" style="font-size: smaller; margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;">By E. W. Roberts, M. E.</p>

<p>A reprint in a handy form of Mr. Robert's
instructive and interesting <span class="smcap">Rudder</span> articles.
In it the author explains what a gasoline motor
is, and points out in understandable language
the difference between the types, and shows
what is a good motor and what is a bad one.</p>

<p style="font-size: smaller;">He gives valuable information to the buyer, and also
explains how to run a motor, how to prevent breakdowns,
and how to remedy defects.</p>

<p style="font-size: smaller;">To the novice, the chapter on <i>gasoline</i> is alone worth
the price of the book, as it explains the properties of that
fluid, and the proper manner in which to handle it so as
to prevent accidents.</p>

<p style="font-size: smaller;">No motor man should be without a copy of this book;
it will save him time, trouble and expense.</p>

<p class="ad-header" style="text-align: center; letter-spacing: 0.3em; word-spacing: 1em;"><i>The Rudder</i></p>

<p>The policy of <span class="smcap">The Rudder</span> is to give to
yachtsmen a thoroughly practical periodical,
dealing with the sport of yachting in all its
phases, and especially to furnish them with
the designs and plans of vessels adapted to their
wants in all localities.</p>

<p style="font-size: smaller">In each issue is a design of a sailing or power craft, and at
least four times a year a complete set of working drawings is given,
so that the unskilled can try a hand at building with a certainty
of making a success of the attempt.</p>

<p style="font-size: smaller">In the last two years over 500 boats have been built from designs
printed in the magazine, and in almost every case have
given satisfaction.</p>

<p style="font-size: smaller">Outside of the strictly practical, the magazine has always a
cargo of readable things in the way of cruises and tales, while its
illustrations are noted for their novelty and beauty.</p>

<p style="font-size: smaller">The editor desires to increase the size of the magazine
and to add to its features. In order to do this it is necessary that
it be given the hearty support of all who are interested in the sport.
The cost of a subscription, $2 a year rolled or $2.50 mailed flat, is as
low as it is possible to make it and furnish a first-class publication,
and he asks yachtsmen to subscribe, as in that way they can materially
assist him in keeping the magazine up to its present standard
of excellence.</p>
